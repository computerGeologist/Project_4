0,In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
1,"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. "
2,"And God said, Let there be light"
3,"And God saw the light, that it was good"
4,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. "
5,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. "
6,"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament"
7,And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 
8,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear"
9,And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas
10,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth"
11,"And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind"
12,And the evening and the morning were the third day. 
13,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years"
14,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night"
15,"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, "
16,And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 
17,"And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. "
18,"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind"
19,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. "
20,And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 
21,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind"
22,"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind"
23,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"
24,"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. "
25,"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it"
26,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. "
27,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat"
28,"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. "
29,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. "
30,And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
31,"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it"
32,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, "
33,"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. "
34,"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. "
35,And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
36,"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. "
37,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. "
38,The name of the first is Pison
39,And the name of the second river is Gihon
40,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel
41,"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. "
42,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat"
43,"And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. "
44,"And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them"
45,"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. "
46,"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept"
47,"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh"
48,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife"
49,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. "
50,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? "
51,"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die"
52,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. "
53,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. "
54,And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day
55,"And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? "
56,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? "
57,"And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. "
58,"And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life"
59,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. "
60,"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it"
61,And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. 
62,"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. "
63,"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil"
64,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. "
65,"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. "
66,"And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. "
67,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. "
68,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering"
69,"And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? "
70,And Cain talked with Abel his brother
71,"And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not"
72,"And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; "
73,"And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. "
74,"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. "
75,"And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. "
76,"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. "
77,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch"
78,And unto Enoch was born Irad
79,And Lamech took unto him two wives
80,And Adah bare Jabal
81,And his brother's name was Jubal
82,"And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron"
83,"And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech"
84,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. "
85,"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth"
86,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos"
87,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; "
88,"And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth"
89,"And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos"
90,"And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan"
91,And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel
92,"And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared"
93,"And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch"
94,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah"
95,"And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. "
96,"And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters"
97,"And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son"
98,"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters"
99,And Noah was five hundred years old
100,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, "
101,"And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh"
102,"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. "
103,"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. "
104,"And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. "
105,"And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. "
106,But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 
107,These are the generations of Noah
108,"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. "
109,"The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. "
110,"And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. "
111,"And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. "
112,"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. "
113,And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of
114,"A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. "
115,"And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. "
116,"But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. "
117,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. "
118,"Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. "
119,"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. "
120,"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. "
121,"And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. "
122,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female"
123,"Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. "
124,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. "
125,And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. 
126,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 
127,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. "
128,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, "
129,"And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. "
130,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. "
131,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
132,"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; "
133,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. "
134,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him"
135,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. "
136,"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. "
137,"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. "
138,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 
139,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man"
140,"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth"
141,And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 
142,"And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark"
143,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. "
144,And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month
145,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made"
146,"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; "
147,And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 
148,And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 
149,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth"
150,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. "
151,"And God spake unto Noah, saying, "
152,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. "
153,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him"
154,"And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. "
155,"And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. "
156,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. "
157,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. "
158,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. "
159,Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 
160,"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. "
161,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. "
162,"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed"
163,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. "
164,"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, "
165,"And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. "
166,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations"
167,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud"
168,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. "
169,"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. "
170,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth"
171,These are the three sons of Noah
172,"And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard"
173,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. "
174,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. "
175,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. "
176,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. "
177,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. "
178,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. "
179,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
180,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years
181,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth"
182,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. "
183,"And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. "
184,"And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. "
185,"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. "
186,"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. "
187,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah"
188,And Cush begat Nimrod
189,He was a mighty hunter before the LORD
190,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. "
191,"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, "
192,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, "
193,"And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, "
194,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. "
195,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. "
196,"Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. "
197,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. "
198,"And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. "
199,And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 
200,And unto Eber were born two sons
201,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, "
202,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. "
203,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. "
204,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations"
205,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. "
206,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. "
207,"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. "
208,"And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. "
209,"And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. "
210,"And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do"
211,"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. "
212,So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth
213,Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth
214,These are the generations of Shem
215,"And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah"
216,"And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber"
217,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg"
218,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu"
219,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug"
220,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor"
221,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah"
222,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. "
223,Now these are the generations of Terah
224,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. "
225,And Abram and Nahor took them wives
226,But Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
227,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. "
228,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years
229,"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee"
230,"So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him"
231,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. "
232,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. "
233,"And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land"
234,"And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east"
235,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. "
236,And there was a famine in the land
237,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon"
238,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister"
239,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. "
240,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh"
241,And he entreated Abram well for her sake
242,And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 
243,"And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? "
244,And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him
245,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. "
246,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. "
247,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; "
248,"And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. "
249,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together"
250,And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle
251,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. "
252,"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me"
253,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. "
254,Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east
255,"Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. "
256,But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. 
257,"And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward"
258,And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth
259,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. "
260,"Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD. "
261,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; "
262,"All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. "
263,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. "
264,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, "
265,"And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar. "
266,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; "
267,"And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. "
268,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. "
269,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. "
270,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner"
271,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. "
272,"And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. "
273,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. "
274,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. "
275,And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine
276,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth"
277,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. "
278,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, "
279,"After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram"
280,"And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? "
281,"And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. "
282,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them"
283,And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. 
284,"And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. "
285,"And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? "
286,"And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another"
287,"And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. "
288,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. "
289,"And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; "
290,And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 
291,But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again
292,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. "
293,"In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates"
294,Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children
295,"And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing"
296,"And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. "
297,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived"
298,"And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee"
299,"But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. "
300,"And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. "
301,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. "
302,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. "
303,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. "
304,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. "
305,"And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. "
306,"And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me"
307,And Hagar bare Abram a son
308,"And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. "
309,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. "
310,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. "
311,And Abram fell on his face
312,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. "
313,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. "
314,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. "
315,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. "
316,"And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. "
317,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. "
318,And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. 
319,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. "
320,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised"
321,"And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. "
322,"And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. "
323,"And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her"
324,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? "
325,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee"
326,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. "
327,"And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. "
328,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. "
329,"And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. "
330,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. "
331,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. "
332,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. "
333,And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre
334,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. "
335,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. "
336,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. "
337,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. "
338,"And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. "
339,Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 
340,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? "
341,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. "
342,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom"
343,"And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; "
344,"And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; "
345,"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom"
346,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? "
347,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes"
348,"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. "
349,"And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak"
350,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD"
351,"And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once"
352,"And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham"
353,And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom
354,"And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. "
355,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter"
356,"And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, "
357,"Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes"
358,"And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge"
359,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. "
360,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great"
361,"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place"
362,"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. "
363,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. "
364,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him"
365,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. "
366,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD"
367,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. "
368,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. "
369,The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 
370,Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 
371,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. "
372,And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD
373,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. "
374,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar"
375,"And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth"
376,And they made their father drink wine that night
377,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father"
378,And they made their father drink wine that night also
379,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
380,"And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab"
381,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi"
382,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. "
383,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister"
384,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. "
385,But Abimelech had not come near her
386,"And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me"
387,"Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live"
388,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears"
389,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. "
390,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? "
391,"And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. "
392,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. "
393,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. "
394,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee"
395,"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver"
396,So Abraham prayed unto God
397,"For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. "
398,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. "
399,"For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. "
400,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. "
401,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. "
402,"And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. "
403,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me. "
404,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. "
405,"And the child grew, and was weaned"
406,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. "
407,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son"
408,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. 
409,"And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. "
410,"And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. "
411,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away"
412,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. "
413,"And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot"
414,"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. "
415,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. "
416,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. "
417,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. "
418,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran
419,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest"
420,"And Abraham said, I will swear. "
421,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. "
422,"And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. "
423,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. "
424,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
425,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? "
426,Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. 
427,Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba
428,"And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. "
429,And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days. 
430,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham"
431,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. "
432,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. "
433,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. "
434,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. "
435,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. "
436,"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father"
437,"And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. "
438,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. "
439,"And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham"
440,"And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him"
441,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns"
442,And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh
443,"And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, "
444,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. "
445,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; "
446,And Bethuel begat Rebekah
447,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. "
448,And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old
449,And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan
450,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, "
451,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, "
452,"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. "
453,"And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, "
454,And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth
455,And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. 
456,"And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me"
457,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, "
458,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. "
459,"And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure "
460,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre"
461,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth. "
462,"And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age"
463,"And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh"
464,"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land"
465,"The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. "
466,"And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath"
467,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. "
468,"And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand"
469,"And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. "
470,"And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. "
471,"Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water"
472,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. "
473,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her"
474,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. "
475,"And she said, Drink, my lord"
476,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. "
477,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. "
478,"And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. "
479,"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; "
480,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. "
481,"And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. "
482,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth"
483,"And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things. "
484,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban"
485,"And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. "
486,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels. "
487,And the man came into the house
488,And there was set meat before him to eat
489,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant. "
490,And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great
491,And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old
492,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell"
493,"And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. "
494,"And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house"
495,"And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go"
496,"And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water"
497,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also"
498,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him"
499,"And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. "
500,"And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me"
501,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD"
502,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. "
503,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. "
504,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah"
505,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. "
506,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. "
507,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. "
508,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. "
509,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. "
510,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. "
511,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. "
512,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man"
513,And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 
514,And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide
515,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. "
516,"For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master"
517,And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 
518,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her"
519,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. "
520,"And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. "
521,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. "
522,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. "
523,And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
524,"But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. "
525,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. "
526,"Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. "
527,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; "
528,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. "
529,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham"
530,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years"
531,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria"
532,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son"
533,"And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren"
534,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. "
535,"And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. "
536,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. "
537,"And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. "
538,"And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob"
539,And the boys grew
540,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison"
541,And Jacob sod pottage
542,"And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. "
543,"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die"
544,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way"
545,"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. "
546,"And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of"
547,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar
548,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. "
549,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. "
550,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. "
551,"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. "
552,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold"
553,"And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great"
554,"For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. "
555,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. "
556,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. "
557,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham"
558,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. "
559,"And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours"
560,"And they digged another well, and strove for that also"
561,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not"
562,And he went up from thence to Beersheba. 
563,"And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father"
564,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there"
565,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. "
566,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? "
567,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. "
568,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another"
569,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. "
570,And he called it Shebah
571,"And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite"
572,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son"
573,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death"
574,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. "
575,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, "
576,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. "
577,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth"
578,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man"
579,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son"
580,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother"
581,"And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son"
582,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father"
583,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. "
584,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. "
585,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. "
586,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands"
587,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. "
588,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat"
589,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. "
590,"And he came near, and kissed him"
591,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. "
592,"And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. "
593,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. "
594,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed. "
595,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father. "
596,"And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. "
597,"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times"
598,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; "
599,And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him
600,And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah
601,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; "
602,"Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother. "
603,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; "
604,And Isaac sent away Jacob
605,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan; "
606,"And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. "
607,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. "
608,"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven"
609,"And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac"
610,"And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. "
611,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not. "
612,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. "
613,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. "
614,And he called the name of that place Bethel
615,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, "
616,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. "
617,"And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks"
618,And thither were all the flocks gathered
619,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. "
620,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. "
621,"And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well"
622,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together"
623,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. "
624,"And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them. "
625,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. "
626,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. "
627,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son"
628,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. "
629,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. "
630,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? "
631,Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 
632,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. "
633,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man"
634,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. "
635,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. "
636,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. "
637,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. "
638,And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. 
639,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah"
640,"Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. "
641,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week"
642,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 
643,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. "
644,"And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb"
645,"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben"
646,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also"
647,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons"
648,"And she conceived again, and bare a son"
649,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. "
650,And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel
651,And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife
652,"And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. "
653,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son"
654,"And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. "
655,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed"
656,"When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. "
657,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. 
658,"And Leah said, A troop cometh"
659,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 
660,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed"
661,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. "
662,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. "
663,"And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. "
664,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. "
665,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband"
666,"And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. "
667,"And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons"
668,"And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. "
669,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. "
670,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach"
671,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. "
672,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go"
673,"And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry"
674,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. "
675,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. "
676,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming"
677,"I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats"
678,"So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face"
679,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. "
680,"And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. "
681,And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob
682,"And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. "
683,"And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. "
684,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. "
685,"And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. "
686,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. "
687,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in"
688,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. "
689,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory. "
690,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. "
691,"And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. "
692,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, "
693,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 
694,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. "
695,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled"
696,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. "
697,"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. "
698,"And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob"
699,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled"
700,"I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me"
701,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? "
702,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's"
703,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; "
704,And Laban went to shear his sheep
705,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. "
706,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. "
707,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 
708,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. "
709,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. "
710,Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount
711,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? "
712,It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt
713,"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? "
714,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live"
715,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. "
716,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not. "
717,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images. "
718,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban"
719,"This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. "
720,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. "
721,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. "
722,"Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle"
723,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. "
724,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine"
725,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. "
726,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap"
727,And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha
728,"And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. "
729,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. "
730,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee"
731,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. "
732,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread"
733,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them"
734,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. "
735,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host"
736,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. "
737,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now"
738,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. "
739,Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed
740,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee"
741,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau"
742,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. "
743,And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
744,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. "
745,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? "
746,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. "
747,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. "
748,So went the present over before him
749,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. "
750,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. "
751,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
752,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. "
753,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. "
754,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. "
755,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel"
756,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. "
757,And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel
758,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. "
759,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day"
760,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. "
761,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. "
762,"And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. "
763,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him"
764,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. "
765,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. "
766,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves"
767,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. "
768,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. "
769,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand"
770,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it. "
771,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. "
772,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me"
773,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant"
774,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. "
775,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
776,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle"
777,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. "
778,"And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. "
779,"And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael. "
780,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. "
781,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. "
782,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. "
783,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. "
784,And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter
785,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. 
786,And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it
787,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter"
788,"And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. "
789,And ye shall dwell with us
790,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. "
791,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me"
792,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister"
793,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. "
794,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. "
795,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter"
796,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, "
797,"Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. "
798,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. "
799,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. "
800,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. "
801,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. "
802,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. "
803,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, "
804,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites"
805,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot? "
806,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments"
807,"And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. "
808,And they journeyed
809,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. "
810,"And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel"
811,"But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak"
812,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him. "
813,"And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob"
814,"And God said unto him, I am God Almighty"
815,And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
816,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone"
817,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. "
818,And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath
819,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. "
820,"And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni"
821,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. "
822,And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave
823,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. "
824,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine"
825,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. "
826,And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. 
827,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days"
828,"Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. "
829,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; "
830,And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 
831,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. "
832,For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. 
833,Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir
834,And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir
835,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. "
836,And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek
837,"And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah"
838,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife"
839,These were dukes of the sons of Esau
840,"And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah"
841,"And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah"
842,"These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes. "
843,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, "
844,And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 
845,"And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. "
846,"And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah"
847,"And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah. "
848,"And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. "
849,"The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan. "
850,"The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran. "
851,"These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, "
852,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. "
853,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom
854,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. "
855,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. "
856,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead"
857,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. "
858,"And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. "
859,"And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. "
860,"And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead"
861,"And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, "
862,"And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. "
863,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives"
864,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age"
865,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. "
866,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren"
867,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed"
868,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. "
869,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. "
870,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren"
871,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 
872,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. "
873,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. "
874,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field"
875,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. "
876,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. "
877,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. "
878,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him"
879,"And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. "
880,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. "
881,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; "
882,And they sat down to eat bread
883,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? "
884,"Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver"
885,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. "
886,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? "
887,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. "
888,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. "
889,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. "
890,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard. "
891,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. "
892,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. "
893,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. "
894,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. "
895,"And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah"
896,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. "
897,"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. "
898,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. "
899,"And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. "
900,And the thing which he did displeased the LORD
901,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown"
902,"And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. "
903,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. "
904,"And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. "
905,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. "
906,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? "
907,"And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. "
908,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand"
909,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. "
910,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. "
911,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed"
912,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. "
913,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child"
914,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. "
915,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. "
916,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand"
917,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out"
918,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand"
919,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. "
920,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. "
921,"And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. "
922,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him"
923,"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. "
924,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured. "
925,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. "
926,"But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; "
927,"And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. "
928,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me"
929,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, "
930,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. "
931,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me"
932,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. "
933,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound"
934,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. "
935,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. "
936,"The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. "
937,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. "
938,"And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. "
939,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. "
940,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them"
941,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. "
942,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. "
943,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? "
944,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; "
945,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it"
946,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house"
947,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head"
948,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof"
949,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants"
950,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand
951,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. "
952,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed"
953,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. "
954,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. "
955,And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
956,And he slept and dreamed the second time
957,"And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. "
958,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. "
959,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof"
960,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day"
961,"And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. "
962,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. "
963,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon"
964,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it"
965,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me"
966,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river"
967,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good"
968,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one"
969,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years
970,And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 
971,This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh
972,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt"
973,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. "
974,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. "
975,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. "
976,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. "
977,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. "
978,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. "
979,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? "
980,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. "
981,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; "
982,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. "
983,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. 
984,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. "
985,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
986,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities"
987,"And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. "
988,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. "
989,And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh
990,And the name of the second called he Ephraim
991,"And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. "
992,"And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said"
993,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread"
994,And the famine was over all the face of the earth
995,And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands. 
996,"Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? "
997,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
998,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. "
999,And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came
1000,"And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land"
1001,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. "
1002,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. "
1003,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. "
1004,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. "
1005,"We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. "
1006,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. "
1007,"And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. "
1008,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies"
1009,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you"
1010,And he put them all together into ward three days. 
1011,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God"
1012,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. "
1013,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. "
1014,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. 
1015,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. "
1016,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way"
1017,"And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. "
1018,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. "
1019,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack"
1020,"And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies"
1021,"And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone"
1022,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack"
1023,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children"
1024,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee"
1025,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone"
1026,And the famine was sore in the land. 
1027,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. "
1028,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. "
1029,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food"
1030,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? "
1031,I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him
1032,"And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds"
1033,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. "
1034,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. "
1035,And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 
1036,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. "
1037,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, "
1038,And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food
1039,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not"
1040,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. "
1041,And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon
1042,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. "
1043,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? "
1044,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. "
1045,And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother
1046,"And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. "
1047,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves"
1048,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth"
1049,And he took and sent messes unto them from before him
1050,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. "
1051,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. "
1052,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. "
1053,"And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? "
1054,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. "
1055,"And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing"
1056,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words"
1057,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. "
1058,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest"
1059,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. "
1060,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there
1061,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? "
1062,"And he said, God forbid that I should do so"
1063,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant"
1064,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? "
1065,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. "
1066,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father"
1067,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. "
1068,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. "
1069,"And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. "
1070,"And we said, We cannot go down"
1071,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons"
1072,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; "
1073,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. "
1074,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. "
1075,"For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. "
1076,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. "
1077,And he wept aloud
1078,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. "
1079,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. "
1080,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither"
1081,For these two years hath the famine been in the land
1082,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. "
1083,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God"
1084,"Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt"
1085,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. "
1086,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. "
1087,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. "
1088,"Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them"
1089,"And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come"
1090,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; "
1091,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. "
1092,Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's. 
1093,And the children of Israel did so
1094,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. "
1095,"And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. "
1096,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed"
1097,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, "
1098,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them"
1099,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. "
1100,"And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. "
1101,"And he said, I am God, the God of thy father"
1102,And Jacob rose up from Beersheba
1103,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him"
1104,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons"
1105,"And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. "
1106,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. "
1107,"And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. "
1108,"And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah"
1109,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. "
1110,"And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. "
1111,"These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah"
1112,"And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. "
1113,"And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister"
1114,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. "
1115,"The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. "
1116,"And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. "
1117,"And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. "
1118,"These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob"
1119,And the sons of Dan; Hushim. 
1120,"And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. "
1121,"These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob"
1122,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; "
1123,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. "
1124,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. "
1125,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. "
1126,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; "
1127,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? "
1128,"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. "
1129,"And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. "
1130,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers. "
1131,"They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan"
1132,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee"
1133,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh"
1134,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? "
1135,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. "
1136,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. "
1137,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families. "
1138,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. "
1139,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought"
1140,"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread"
1141,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. "
1142,And they brought their cattle unto Joseph
1143,"When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands"
1144,"And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them"
1145,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof. "
1146,"Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them"
1147,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh"
1148,"And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones. "
1149,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives"
1150,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's. "
1151,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. "
1152,And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years
1153,And the time drew nigh that Israel must die
1154,"And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. "
1155,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick"
1156,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee"
1157,"And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, "
1158,"And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. "
1159,"And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. "
1160,"And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath"
1161,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? "
1162,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. "
1163,"And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face"
1164,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. "
1165,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. "
1166,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. "
1167,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, "
1168,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him"
1169,"And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father"
1170,"And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it"
1171,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh"
1172,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die"
1173,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. "
1174,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. "
1175,"Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. "
1176,"Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power"
1177,Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. 
1178,"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united"
1179,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel"
1180,"Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise"
1181,Judah is a lion's whelp
1182,"Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes"
1183,Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon. 
1184,Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
1185,"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. "
1186,"Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. "
1187,"I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD. "
1188,"Gad, a troop shall overcome him"
1189,"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties. "
1190,Naphtali is a hind let loose
1191,"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall"
1192,Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf
1193,All these are the twelve tribes of Israel
1194,"And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people"
1195,There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
1196,The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth. 
1197,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people. "
1198,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. "
1199,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father
1200,And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed
1201,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, "
1202,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. "
1203,And Joseph went up to bury his father
1204,And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen
1205,"And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation"
1206,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians"
1207,And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them
1208,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. "
1209,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. "
1210,"And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, "
1211,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. "
1212,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not"
1213,Now therefore fear ye not
1214,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house"
1215,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation
1216,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die"
1217,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. "
1218,"So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old"
1219,"Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. "
1220,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, "
1221,And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls
1222,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. "
1223,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. "
1224,"Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. "
1225,"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we"
1226,"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. "
1227,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. "
1228,And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour
1229,"And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah"
1230,"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. "
1231,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? "
1232,Therefore God dealt well with the midwives
1233,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. "
1234,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. "
1235,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. "
1236,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son"
1237,"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. "
1238,"And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. "
1239,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. "
1240,"And when she had opened it, she saw the child"
1241,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? "
1242,"And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it. "
1243,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses"
1244,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens"
1245,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. "
1246,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together"
1247,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian"
1248,Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters
1249,And the shepherds came and drove them away
1250,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? "
1251,"And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. "
1252,And Moses was content to dwell with the man
1253,"And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom"
1254,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died"
1255,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. "
1256,"And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them. "
1257,"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian"
1258,And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush
1259,"And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. "
1260,"And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. "
1261,"And he said, Draw not nigh hither"
1262,"Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. "
1263,"And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; "
1264,"Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me"
1265,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. "
1266,"And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? "
1267,"And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? "
1268,"And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you"
1269,"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt"
1270,And they shall hearken to thy voice
1271,"And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. "
1272,"And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof"
1273,And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians
1274,"But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment"
1275,"And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice"
1276,"And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. "
1277,"And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. "
1278,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand"
1279,"And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom"
1280,"And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. "
1281,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. "
1282,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land"
1283,"And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant"
1284,"And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? "
1285,"And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. "
1286,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee"
1287,"And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth"
1288,And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people
1289,"And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. "
1290,"And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. "
1291,"And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt"
1292,"And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt"
1293,"And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand"
1294,"And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn"
1295,"And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. "
1296,"Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. "
1297,So he let him go
1298,"And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. "
1299,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. "
1300,And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel
1301,And the people believed
1302,"And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. "
1303,"And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. "
1304,"And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us"
1305,"And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. "
1306,"And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. "
1307,"And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, "
1308,"And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof"
1309,"Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. "
1310,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. "
1311,"Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it"
1312,So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 
1313,"And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw. "
1314,"And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? "
1315,"But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle"
1316,"Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. "
1317,"And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task. "
1318,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh"
1319,"And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? "
1320,"Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh"
1321,"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD"
1322,"And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. "
1323,"And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. "
1324,"Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments"
1325,"And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage"
1326,And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel
1327,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1328,"And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? "
1329,These be the heads of their fathers' houses
1330,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman"
1331,"And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari"
1332,"The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. "
1333,"And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel"
1334,And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi
1335,And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses
1336,"And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. "
1337,"And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. "
1338,"And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. "
1339,"And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph"
1340,And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas
1341,"These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. "
1342,"These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt"
1343,"And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, "
1344,"And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? "
1345,"And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh"
1346,Thou shalt speak all that I command thee
1347,"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. "
1348,"But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. "
1349,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. "
1350,"And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. "
1351,"And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. "
1352,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, "
1353,"And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded"
1354,Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers
1355,"For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents"
1356,"And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. "
1357,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. "
1358,"Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. "
1359,"And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness"
1360,"Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD"
1361,"And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. "
1362,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. "
1363,"And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. "
1364,"And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. "
1365,And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments
1366,"And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. "
1367,And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
1368,"And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river. "
1369,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. "
1370,"And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs"
1371,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. "
1372,"And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. "
1373,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. "
1374,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. "
1375,"And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me"
1376,"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. "
1377,And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh
1378,"And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. "
1379,And they gathered them together upon heaps
1380,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. "
1381,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. "
1382,"And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. "
1383,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not"
1384,"Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God"
1385,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. "
1386,"Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses"
1387,"And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. "
1388,And I will put a division between my people and thy people
1389,"And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt"
1390,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. "
1391,"And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God"
1392,"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away"
1393,"And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow"
1394,"And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. "
1395,"And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. "
1396,"And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. "
1397,"Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. "
1398,"For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, "
1399,And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt
1400,"And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land. "
1401,"And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died"
1402,"And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. "
1403,"And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. "
1404,"And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. "
1405,"And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. "
1406,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. "
1407,"And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. "
1408,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. "
1409,"For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. "
1410,"For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. "
1411,"And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. "
1412,"As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? "
1413,"Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. "
1414,He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses
1415,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. "
1416,And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven
1417,"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. "
1418,"And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. "
1419,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. "
1420,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time"
1421,"Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. "
1422,"And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's. "
1423,"But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. "
1424,And the flax and the barley was smitten
1425,But the wheat and the rie were not smitten
1426,"And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD"
1427,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. "
1428,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses. "
1429,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh"
1430,"And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. "
1431,"Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast"
1432,"And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God"
1433,"And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones"
1434,Not so
1435,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. "
1436,"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. "
1437,"And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt"
1438,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left"
1439,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. "
1440,"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only. "
1441,"And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. "
1442,"And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. "
1443,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. "
1444,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. "
1445,And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days
1446,"And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed"
1447,"And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. "
1448,"Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. "
1449,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. "
1450,"And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. "
1451,"And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more. "
1452,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence"
1453,"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold. "
1454,And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. 
1455,"And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt"
1456,"And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. "
1457,"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast"
1458,"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee"
1459,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. "
1460,And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh
1461,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, "
1462,"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house"
1463,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year"
1464,"And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. "
1465,"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. "
1466,"Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. "
1467,And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 
1468,"And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste"
1469,"For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment"
1470,And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are
1471,And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 
1472,Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses
1473,"And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. "
1474,And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt
1475,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. "
1476,Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses
1477,Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. 
1478,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. "
1479,"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. "
1480,"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. "
1481,And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 
1482,"And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. "
1483,"And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? "
1484,"And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. "
1485,"And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. "
1486,"And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. "
1487,"And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. "
1488,"Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. "
1489,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. "
1490,"And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. "
1491,"And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment"
1492,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. "
1493,"And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. "
1494,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. "
1495,"Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. "
1496,"And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. "
1497,It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt
1498,"And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover"
1499,A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. 
1500,In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 
1501,All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
1502,"And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land"
1503,"One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. "
1504,"Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. "
1505,"And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. "
1506,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1507,"And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place"
1508,This day came ye out in the month Abib. 
1509,"And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. "
1510,"Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. "
1511,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. "
1512,"And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. "
1513,"And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth"
1514,Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year. 
1515,"And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, "
1516,"And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck"
1517,"And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage"
1518,"And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes"
1519,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt"
1520,And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him
1521,"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. "
1522,"And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night"
1523,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1524,"For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. "
1525,"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so. "
1526,And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled
1527,"And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel"
1528,"But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. "
1529,"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid"
1530,"And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? "
1531,"And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day"
1532,"The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. "
1533,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward"
1534,"And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them"
1535,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. "
1536,"And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them"
1537,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. "
1538,And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground
1539,"And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. "
1540,"And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, "
1541,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. "
1542,"And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. "
1543,"And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. "
1544,"But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. "
1545,Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 
1546,And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians
1547,"Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously"
1548,"The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation"
1549,The LORD is a man of war
1550,Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea
1551,The depths have covered them
1552,"Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power"
1553,And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee
1554,"And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. "
1555,"The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. "
1556,"Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them"
1557,"Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? "
1558,Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed
1559,"The people shall hear, and be afraid"
1560,"Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. "
1561,"Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. "
1562,"Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established. "
1563,The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. 
1564,"For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. "
1565,"And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. "
1566,"And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. "
1567,"So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. "
1568,"And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter"
1569,"And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? "
1570,"And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees"
1571,"And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. "
1572,And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness
1573,"Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. "
1574,"And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. "
1575,"And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt"
1576,"And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD"
1577,"And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. "
1578,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1579,"And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp"
1580,"And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. "
1581,"And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna"
1582,"This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. "
1583,"And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. "
1584,"And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. "
1585,"And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. "
1586,"Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank"
1587,"And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating"
1588,"And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man"
1589,"And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD"
1590,"And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade"
1591,"And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD"
1592,"Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. "
1593,"And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. "
1594,"And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? "
1595,So the people rested on the seventh day. 
1596,And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna
1597,"And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. "
1598,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. "
1599,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. "
1600,"And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. "
1601,Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. 
1602,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim"
1603,"Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? "
1604,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. "
1605,"Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. "
1606,"And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? "
1607,"And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek"
1608,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek"
1609,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed"
1610,"But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. "
1611,And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
1612,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua"
1613,"And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi"
1614,"When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; "
1615,"And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. "
1616,"And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. "
1617,"And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. "
1618,"And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. "
1619,Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods
1620,"And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God"
1621,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people"
1622,"And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? "
1623,"And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. "
1624,"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee"
1625,"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee"
1626,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens"
1627,"If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. "
1628,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. "
1629,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. "
1630,And they judged the people at all seasons
1631,And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land. 
1632,"In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. "
1633,"For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. "
1634,"And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; "
1635,"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people"
1636,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. "
1637,"And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. "
1638,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. "
1639,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, "
1640,"And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it"
1641,"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. "
1642,"And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day"
1643,"And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. "
1644,And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
1645,"And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire"
1646,"And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. "
1647,"And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount"
1648,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. "
1649,"And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. "
1650,"And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai"
1651,"And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee"
1652,"So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. "
1653,"And God spake all these words, saying, "
1654,Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
1655,"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. "
1656,"Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them"
1657,Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
1658,"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. "
1659,"Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work"
1660,Honour thy father and thy mother
1661,Thou shalt not kill. 
1662,Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
1663,Thou shalt not steal. 
1664,Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
1665,"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. "
1666,"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking"
1667,"And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear"
1668,"And Moses said unto the people, Fear not"
1669,"And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. "
1670,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. "
1671,"Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. "
1672,"An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen"
1673,"And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone"
1674,"Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon. "
1675,Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 
1676,"If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve"
1677,"If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself"
1678,"If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. "
1679,"And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free"
1680,"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. "
1681,"If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed"
1682,"And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. "
1683,"If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. "
1684,"And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money. "
1685,"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. "
1686,"And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. "
1687,"But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. "
1688,"And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. "
1689,"And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. "

1929,"Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration"
1930,"And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD"
1931,"And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD"
1932,"And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons"
1933,"And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. "
1934,"And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place. "
1935,"And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. "
1936,"And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. "
1937,"And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them"
1938,"And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire"
1939,"And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee"
1940,And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement
1941,"Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy"
1942,Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 
1943,The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even
1944,"And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. "
1945,This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD
1946,"And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. "
1947,"And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar"
1948,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. "
1949,"And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them"
1950,And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon
1951,"A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be"
1952,"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. "
1953,"And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. "
1954,"And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. "
1955,"And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. "
1956,And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning
1957,"And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. "
1958,"Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. "
1959,And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements
1960,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1961,"This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary"
1962,"Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. "
1963,"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. "
1964,"And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. "
1965,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1966,For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat
1967,"Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1968,"And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, "
1969,"And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy"
1970,"And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. "
1971,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. "
1972,"Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it"
1973,"Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. "
1974,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense"
1975,"And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof"
1976,"Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people. "
1977,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1978,"And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan"
1979,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
1980,Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you
1981,"Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD"
1982,"Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. "
1983,It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever
1984,"And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. "
1985,"And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. "
1986,"And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. "
1987,"And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. "
1988,"And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf"
1989,"And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. "
1990,"And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. "
1991,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves"
1992,"And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people"
1993,"And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? "
1994,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. "
1995,And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. 
1996,"And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand"
1997,"And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. "
1998,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. "
1999,"And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome"
2000,"And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing"
2001,"And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. "
2002,"And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? "
2003,"For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us"
2004,"And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me"
2005,And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies
2006,"And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. "
2007,And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses
2008,"For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. "
2009,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin"
2010,"And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. "
2011,"Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. "
2012,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. "
2013,"Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee"
2014,"And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made. "
2015,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it"
2016,"And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned"
2017,"For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people"
2018,And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. 
2019,"And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. "
2020,"And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. "
2021,"And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses. "
2022,And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door
2023,"And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp"
2024,"And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people"
2025,"Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight"
2026,"And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. "
2027,"And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. "
2028,"For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. "
2029,"And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken"
2030,"And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. "
2031,"And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. "
2032,"And he said, Thou canst not see my face"
2033,"And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock"
2034,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first"
2035,"And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. "
2036,"And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. "
2037,"And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. "
2038,"And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. "
2039,"And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, "
2040,"And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. "
2041,"And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. "
2042,"And he said, Behold, I make a covenant"
2043,Observe thou that which I command thee this day
2044,"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee"
2045,Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 
2046,"The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib"
2047,"All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. "
2048,But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb
2049,"Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest"
2050,"And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. "
2051,"Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel. "
2052,"For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders"
2053,Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 
2054,The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
2055,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words"
2056,"And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. "
2057,"And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. "
2058,"And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. "
2059,And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him
2060,And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh
2061,"And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. "
2062,"But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. "
2063,"And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone"
2064,"And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them. "
2065,"Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD"
2066,Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. 
2067,"And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, "
2068,"And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded; "
2069,And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
2070,"And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. "
2071,"And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold"
2072,"And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them. "
2073,Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD's offering
2074,"And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. "
2075,And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair. 
2076,"And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; "
2077,"The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses. "
2078,"And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; "
2079,"And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. "
2080,"Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work. "
2081,"Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded. "
2082,"And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it"
2083,"And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; "
2084,"And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. "
2085,"For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. "
2086,"And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet"
2087,"The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits"
2088,And he coupled the five curtains one unto another
2089,And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling
2090,"Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second"
2091,"And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches"
2092,And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle
2093,"The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain"
2094,"And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. "
2095,"And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. "
2096,"And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. "
2097,"And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that. "
2098,"And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up. "
2099,"The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. "
2100,"One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another"
2101,And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward
2102,"And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, "
2103,And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
2104,And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 
2105,"And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring"
2106,"And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets. "
2107,"And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, "
2108,And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other. 
2109,"And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. "
2110,"And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen"
2111,"And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold"
2112,"And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; "
2113,And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood
2114,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. "
2115,"And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. "
2116,"And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. "
2117,And he made the mercy seat of pure gold
2118,"And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; "
2119,"And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims. "
2120,And he made the table of shittim wood
2121,Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. 
2122,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof. "
2123,"Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table. "
2124,"And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. "
2125,"And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold. "
2126,And he made the candlestick of pure gold
2127,"And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers"
2128,Their knops and their branches were of the same
2129,"And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold. "
2130,"Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof. "
2131,And he made the incense altar of shittim wood
2132,"And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it"
2133,"And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal. "
2134,"And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. "
2135,"And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary. "
2136,And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood
2137,And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same
2138,"And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans"
2139,And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it. 
2140,"And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves. "
2141,"And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass. "
2142,"And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards. "
2143,"And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. "
2144,And he made the court
2145,"And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. "
2146,"And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. "
2147,And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. 
2148,"The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. "
2149,"And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. "
2150,All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. 
2151,And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 
2152,"And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen"
2153,"And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver. "
2154,"And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass. "
2155,"This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. "
2156,"And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses. "
2157,"And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. "
2158,"All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. "
2159,"And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary"
2160,"And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. "
2161,"And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them. "
2162,"And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. "
2163,"And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar, "
2164,"And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2165,"And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. "
2166,"And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work. "
2167,"They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together"
2168,"And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2169,"And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. "
2170,"And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2171,"And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. "
2172,It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double
2173,And they set in it four rows of stones
2174,"And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. "
2175,"And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. "
2176,"And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper"
2177,"And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. "
2178,"And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold. "
2179,"And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. "
2180,And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. 
2181,"And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. "
2182,"And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward. "
2183,"And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. "
2184,"And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2185,"And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. "
2186,"And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. "
2187,"And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. "
2188,"And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; "
2189,"And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, "
2190,"And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. "
2191,"And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2192,Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished
2193,"And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets, "
2194,"According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work. "
2195,"And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it"
2196,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2197,"And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. "
2198,"And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. "
2199,"And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. "
2200,And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
2201,"And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. "
2202,"And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. "
2203,"And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof"
2204,"And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar"
2205,"And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. "
2206,"And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. "
2207,"And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. "
2208,"And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats"
2209,Thus did Moses
2210,"And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. "
2211,"And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. "
2212,"And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2213,"And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark"
2214,"And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. "
2215,And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
2216,"And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. "
2217,And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
2218,And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail
2219,And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. 
2220,"And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2221,"And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal. "
2222,And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat
2223,"And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. "
2224,"Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. "
2225,"And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. "
2226,"And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys"
2227,"And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation, saying, "
2228,"If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a 			 			 male without blemish"
2229,And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and 			 			 it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
2230,And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD
2231,"And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. "
2232,"And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, 			 			 and lay the wood in order upon the fire"
2233,"And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of 			 			 the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without 			 			 blemish. "
2234,And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before 			 			 the LORD
2235,"And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat"
2236,"And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of 			 			 fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young 			 			 pigeons. "
2237,"And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his 			 			 head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung 			 			 out at the side of the altar"
2238,"And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his 			 			 offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and 			 			 put frankincense thereon"
2239,"And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the 			 			 oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or 			 			 unleavened wafers anointed with oil. "
2240,"And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be 			 			 of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. "
2241,"Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon"
2242,"And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it 			 			 shall be made of fine flour with oil. "
2243,And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these 			 			 things unto the LORD
2244,"And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial 			 			 thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar"
2245,And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and 			 			 his sons'
2246,"No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be 			 			 made with leaven"
2247,"As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto 			 			 the LORD"
2248,And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with 			 			 salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to 			 			 be lacking from thy meat offering
2249,"And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the 			 			 LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green 			 			 ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears. "
2250,"And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon"
2251,"And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten 			 			 corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense 			 			 thereof"
2252,"And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer 			 			 it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it 			 			 without blemish before the LORD. "
2253,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill 			 			 it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation"
2254,"And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an 			 			 offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the 			 			 inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, "
2255,"And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt 			 			 sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire"
2256,"And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the 			 			 LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without 			 			 blemish. "
2257,"If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before 			 			 the LORD. "
2258,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill 			 			 it before the tabernacle of the congregation"
2259,"And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an 			 			 offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole 			 			 rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that 			 			 covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, "
2260,And the priest shall burn it upon the altar
2261,"And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the 			 			 LORD. "
2262,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before 			 			 the tabernacle of the congregation"
2263,"And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by 			 			 fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat 			 			 that is upon the inwards, "
2264,And the priest shall burn them upon the altar
2265,"It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout 			 			 all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood. "
2266,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2267,"And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of 			 			 the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the 			 			 bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD. "
2268,"And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, 			 			 and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation"
2269,"And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the 			 			 altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of 			 			 the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the 			 			 bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation. "
2270,"And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the 			 			 sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that 			 			 is upon the inwards, "
2271,"And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, 			 			 and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, "
2272,"And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, 			 			 and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done 			 			 somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things 			 			 which should not be done, and are guilty; "
2273,And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the 			 			 head of the bullock before the LORD
2274,And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's 			 			 blood to the tabernacle of the congregation
2275,"And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar 			 			 which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the 			 			 altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of 			 			 the congregation. "
2276,"And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the 			 			 altar. "
2277,"And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a 			 			 sin offering, so shall he do with this"
2278,"And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn 			 			 him as he burned the first bullock"
2279,"When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance 			 			 against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things 			 			 which should not be done, and is guilty; "
2280,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with 			 			 his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, 			 			 and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt 			 			 offering. "
2281,"And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the 			 			 sacrifice of peace offerings"
2282,"And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while 			 			 he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD 			 			 concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; "
2283,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and 			 			 slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. "
2284,"And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, 			 			 and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall 			 			 pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. "
2285,"And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken 			 			 away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall 			 			 burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the 			 			 priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. "
2286,"And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a 			 			 female without blemish. "
2287,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and 			 			 slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt 			 			 offering. "
2288,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with 			 			 his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, 			 			 and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar"
2289,"And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a 			 			 witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, 			 			 then he shall bear his iniquity. "
2290,"Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of 			 			 an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of 			 			 unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall 			 			 be unclean, and guilty. "
2291,"Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it 			 			 be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he 			 			 knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty. "
2292,"Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do 			 			 good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it 			 			 be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one 			 			 of these. "
2293,"And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, 			 			 that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing"
2294,"And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his 			 			 trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young 			 			 pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a 			 			 burnt offering. "
2295,"And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that 			 			 which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his 			 			 neck, but shall not divide it asunder"
2296,"And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to 			 			 the manner"
2297,"But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young 			 			 pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth 			 			 part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil 			 			 upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon"
2298,"Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take 			 			 his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, 			 			 according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD"
2299,"And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his 			 			 sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him"
2300,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2301,"And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the 			 			 holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the 			 			 priest"
2302,"And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are 			 			 forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist 			 			 it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. "
2303,"And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with 			 			 thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest"
2304,It is a trespass offering
2305,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2306,"And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram 			 			 without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass 			 			 offering, unto the priest"
2307,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2308,"And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen 			 			 breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the 			 			 fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall 			 			 put them beside the altar. "
2309,"And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and 			 			 carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. "
2310,And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not 			 			 be put out
2311,The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go 			 			 out. 
2312,And this is the law of the meat offering
2313,"And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat 			 			 offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is 			 			 upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet 			 			 savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD. "
2314,And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat
2315,"It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for 			 			 their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the 			 			 sin offering, and as the trespass offering. "
2316,All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It 			 			 shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the 			 			 offerings of the LORD made by fire
2317,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2318,"In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou 			 			 shalt bring it in"
2319,And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall 			 			 offer it
2320,For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt
2321,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2322,The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it
2323,Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy
2324,But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken
2325,All the males among the priests shall eat thereof
2326,"And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, 			 			 shall be eaten"
2327,Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering
2328,In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill 			 			 the trespass offering
2329,"And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the 			 			 fat that covereth the inwards, "
2330,Every male among the priests shall eat thereof
2331,"As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering"
2332,"And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the 			 			 priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he 			 			 hath offered. "
2333,"And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that 			 			 is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's 			 			 that offereth it. "
2334,"And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the 			 			 sons of Aaron have, one as much as another. "
2335,"And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he 			 			 shall offer unto the LORD. "
2336,"If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the 			 			 sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and 			 			 unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of 			 			 fine flour, fried. "
2337,"Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread 			 			 with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. "
2338,"And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an 			 			 heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that 			 			 sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. "
2339,And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for 			 			 thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall 			 			 not leave any of it until the morning. 
2340,"But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary 			 			 offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his 			 			 sacrifice"
2341,"And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings 			 			 be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither 			 			 shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it"
2342,And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; 			 			 it shall be burnt with fire
2343,"But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace 			 			 offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon 			 			 him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. "
2344,"Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the 			 			 uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean 			 			 thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which 			 			 pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his 			 			 people. "
2345,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2346,"And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of 			 			 that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use"
2347,"For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an 			 			 offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it 			 			 shall be cut off from his people. "
2348,"Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl 			 			 or of beast, in any of your dwellings. "
2349,"Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that 			 			 soul shall be cut off from his people. "
2350,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2351,"His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, 			 			 the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be 			 			 waved for a wave offering before the LORD. "
2352,And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar
2353,And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave 			 			 offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 
2354,"He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace 			 			 offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part. "
2355,"For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the 			 			 children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, 			 			 and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a 			 			 statute for ever from among the children of Israel. "
2356,"This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the 			 			 anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, 			 			 in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the 			 			 priest's office; "
2357,"This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and 			 			 of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the 			 			 consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; "
2358,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2359,And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was 			 			 gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
2360,"And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the 			 			 LORD commanded to be done. "
2361,"And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. "
2362,"And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and 			 			 clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded 			 			 him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him 			 			 therewith. "
2363,And he put the breastplate upon him
2364,"And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon 			 			 his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the 			 			 LORD commanded Moses. "
2365,"And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and 			 			 all that was therein, and sanctified them. "
2366,"And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed 			 			 the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to 			 			 sanctify them. "
2367,"And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and 			 			 anointed him, to sanctify him. "
2368,"And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and 			 			 girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD 			 			 commanded Moses. "
2369,And he brought the bullock for the sin offering
2370,"And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the 			 			 horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the 			 			 altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified 			 			 it, to make reconciliation upon it. "
2371,"And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul 			 			 above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned 			 			 it upon the altar. "
2372,"But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt 			 			 with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2373,And he brought the ram for the burnt offering
2374,And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar 			 			 round about. 
2375,"And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the 			 			 pieces, and the fat. "
2376,And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt 			 			 the whole ram upon the altar
2377,"And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration"
2378,"And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it 			 			 upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right 			 			 hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. "
2379,"And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the 			 			 tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and 			 			 upon the great toes of their right feet"
2380,"And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon 			 			 the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and 			 			 their fat, and the right shoulder"
2381,"And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the 			 			 altar upon the burnt offering"
2382,"And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering 			 			 before the LORD"
2383,"And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was 			 			 upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, 			 			 and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and 			 			 sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' 			 			 garments with him. "
2384,"And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the 			 			 door of the tabernacle of the congregation"
2385,And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye 			 			 burn with fire. 
2386,"And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at 			 			 an end"
2387,"As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to 			 			 make an atonement for you. "
2388,"Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the 			 			 LORD, that ye die not"
2389,So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by 			 			 the hand of Moses. 
2390,"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and 			 			 his sons, and the elders of Israel; "
2391,"And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye 			 			 a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of 			 			 the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; "
2392,And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle 			 			 of the congregation
2393,"And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye 			 			 should do"
2394,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin 			 			 offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, 			 			 and for the people"
2395,"Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin 			 			 offering, which was for himself. "
2396,And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him
2397,And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. 
2398,"And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto 			 			 him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. "
2399,"And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces 			 			 thereof, and the head"
2400,"And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the 			 			 burnt offering on the altar. "
2401,"And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which 			 			 was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for 			 			 sin, as the first. "
2402,"And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to 			 			 the manner. "
2403,"And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, 			 			 and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the 			 			 morning. "
2404,"He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace 			 			 offerings, which was for the people"
2405,"And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, 			 			 and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt 			 			 offering, and peace offerings. "
2406,"And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, 			 			 and came out, and blessed the people"
2407,"And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon 			 			 the altar the burnt offering and the fat"
2408,"And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his 			 			 censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered 			 			 strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. "
2409,"And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and 			 			 they died before the LORD. "
2410,"Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, 			 			 saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all 			 			 the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. "
2411,"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the 			 			 uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren 			 			 from before the sanctuary out of the camp. "
2412,"So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the 			 			 camp; as Moses had said. "
2413,"And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his 			 			 sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, 			 			 and lest wrath come upon all the people"
2414,"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation, lest ye die"
2415,"And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, "
2416,"And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, 			 			 his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the 			 			 offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside 			 			 the altar"
2417,"And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean 			 			 place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee"
2418,"The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the 			 			 offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering 			 			 before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a 			 			 statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded. "
2419,"And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, 			 			 behold, it was burnt"
2420,"And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered 			 			 their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such 			 			 things have befallen me"
2421,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, 			 			 "
2422,"Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the 			 			 cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. "
2423,"Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or 			 			 of them that divide the hoof"
2424,"And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the 			 			 hoof; he is unclean unto you. "
2425,"And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the 			 			 hoof; he is unclean unto you. "
2426,"And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, 			 			 yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. "
2427,"Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not 			 			 touch; they are unclean to you. "
2428,These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters
2429,"And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the 			 			 rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which 			 			 is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you"
2430,"Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be 			 			 an abomination unto you. "
2431,"And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the 			 			 fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination"
2432,"All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an 			 			 abomination unto you. "
2433,"Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth 			 			 upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon 			 			 the earth; "
2434,"But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, 			 			 shall be an abomination unto you. "
2435,And for these ye shall be unclean
2436,"And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash 			 			 his clothes, and be unclean until the even. "
2437,"The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not 			 			 clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you"
2438,"And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts 			 			 that go on all four, those are unclean unto you"
2439,"And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, 			 			 and be unclean until the even"
2440,"These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things 			 			 that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise 			 			 after his kind, "
2441,These are unclean to you among all that creep
2442,"And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, 			 			 it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or 			 			 skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it 			 			 must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it 			 			 shall be cleansed. "
2443,"And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, 			 			 whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. "
2444,"Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh 			 			 shall be unclean"
2445,"And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth 			 			 shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall 			 			 be broken down"
2446,"Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of 			 			 water, shall be clean"
2447,"And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which 			 			 is to be sown, it shall be clean. "
2448,"But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their 			 			 carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you. "
2449,"And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the 			 			 carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. "
2450,"And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, 			 			 and be unclean until the even"
2451,And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be 			 			 an abomination; it shall not be eaten. 
2452,"Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all 			 			 four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that 			 			 creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an 			 			 abomination. "
2453,"Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing 			 			 that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, 			 			 that ye should be defiled thereby. "
2454,For I am the LORD your God
2455,"For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, 			 			 to be your God"
2456,"This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every 			 			 living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that 			 			 creepeth upon the earth"
2457,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2458,And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be 			 			 circumcised. 
2459,"And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three 			 			 and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the 			 			 sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. "
2460,"But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two 			 			 weeks, as in her separation"
2461,"And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or 			 			 for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt 			 			 offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, 			 			 unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest"
2462,"And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two 			 			 turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the 			 			 other for a sin offering"
2463,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, "
2464,"If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in 			 			 sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned 			 			 white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven 			 			 days"
2465,"But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he 			 			 hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of 			 			 the priest again. "
2466,"And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the 			 			 skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean"
2467,"When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought 			 			 unto the priest; "
2468,"And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy 			 			 cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to 			 			 his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; "
2469,"But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. "
2470,"And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be 			 			 unclean"
2471,"Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he 			 			 shall come unto the priest; "
2472,"The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, 			 			 and is healed, "
2473,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white 			 			 hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat 			 			 dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days"
2474,"But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is 			 			 a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. "
2475,"Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot 			 			 burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, 			 			 somewhat reddish, or white; "
2476,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white 			 			 hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but 			 			 be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days"
2477,"And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the 			 			 skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the 			 			 priest shall pronounce him clean"
2478,If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; 			 			 
2479,"And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, 			 			 it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black 			 			 hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of 			 			 the scall seven days"
2480,But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; 			 			 
2481,"But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is 			 			 black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean"
2482,"If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright 			 			 spots, even white bright spots; "
2483,"And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet 			 			 is he clean. "
2484,"And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head 			 			 toward his face, he is forehead bald"
2485,"And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white 			 			 reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald 			 			 forehead. "
2486,Then the priest shall look upon it
2487,"And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, 			 			 and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and 			 			 shall cry, Unclean, unclean. "
2488,All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be 			 			 defiled; he is unclean
2489,"The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be 			 			 a woollen garment, or a linen garment; "
2490,"He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in 			 			 woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is"
2491,"And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not 			 			 spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any 			 			 thing of skin; "
2492,"And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark 			 			 after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or 			 			 out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof"
2493,"And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of 			 			 skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from 			 			 them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. "
2494,"This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen 			 			 or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to 			 			 pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. "
2495,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2496,"And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave 			 			 off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean"
2497,"But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his 			 			 hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he 			 			 shall shave off"
2498,"And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without 			 			 blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three 			 			 tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and 			 			 one log of oil. "
2499,"And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that 			 			 is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of 			 			 the tabernacle of the congregation"
2500,"And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an 			 			 atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and 			 			 afterward he shall kill the burnt offering"
2501,"And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take 			 			 one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for 			 			 him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat 			 			 offering, and a log of oil; "
2502,"And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto 			 			 the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 			 			 before the LORD. "
2503,"And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and 			 			 the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering 			 			 before the LORD"
2504,"And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young 			 			 pigeons, such as he can get; "
2505,"This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose 			 			 hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing. "
2506,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, "
2507,"And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after 			 			 that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the 			 			 house, and after it is plaistered; "
2508,"And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the 			 			 timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry 			 			 them forth out of the city into an unclean place. "
2509,Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is 			 			 shut up shall be unclean until the even. 
2510,And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he 			 			 that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 
2511,"And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, 			 			 the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was 			 			 plaistered"
2512,"And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar 			 			 wood, and scarlet, and hyssop"
2513,"This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall, 			 			 "
2514,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, "
2515,And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue
2516,"Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean"
2517,"And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe 			 			 himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
2518,"And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the 			 			 issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be 			 			 unclean until the even. "
2519,"And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall 			 			 wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the 			 			 even. "
2520,"And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then 			 			 he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean 			 			 until the even. "
2521,And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall 			 			 be unclean. 
2522,And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be 			 			 unclean until the even
2523,"And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not 			 			 rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe 			 			 himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
2524,"And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, 			 			 shall be broken"
2525,"And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he 			 			 shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his 			 			 clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. "
2526,"And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or 			 			 two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest"
2527,"And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he 			 			 shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. "
2528,"And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of 			 			 copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. "
2529,"The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, 			 			 they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the 			 			 even. "
2530,"And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be 			 			 blood, she shall be put apart seven days"
2531,And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be 			 			 unclean
2532,"And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe 			 			 himself in water, and be unclean until the even. "
2533,"And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash 			 			 his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the 			 			 even. "
2534,"And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, 			 			 when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. "
2535,"And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, 			 			 he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall 			 			 be unclean. "
2536,"And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the 			 			 time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her 			 			 separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as 			 			 the days of her separation"
2537,Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be 			 			 unto her as the bed of her separation
2538,"And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall 			 			 wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the 			 			 even. "
2539,"But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to 			 			 herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. "
2540,"And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or 			 			 two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation. "
2541,"And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the 			 			 other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for 			 			 her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness. "
2542,"Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their 			 			 uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile 			 			 my tabernacle that is among them. "
2543,"This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed 			 			 goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; "
2544,"And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of 			 			 Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died; "
2545,Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place
2546,"He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen 			 			 breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and 			 			 with the linen mitre shall he be attired"
2547,"And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel 			 			 two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt 			 			 offering. "
2548,"And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is 			 			 for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. "
2549,"And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD 			 			 at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. "
2550,"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the 			 			 LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. "
2551,"And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, 			 			 and offer him for a sin offering. "
2552,"But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall 			 			 be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and 			 			 to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. "
2553,"And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is 			 			 for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his 			 			 house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for 			 			 himself"
2554,"Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the 			 			 people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as 			 			 he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy 			 			 seat, and before the mercy seat"
2555,"And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation 			 			 when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come 			 			 out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, 			 			 and for all the congregation of Israel. "
2556,"And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and 			 			 make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, 			 			 and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar 			 			 round about. "
2557,"And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven 			 			 times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the 			 			 children of Israel. "
2558,"And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and 			 			 the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the 			 			 live goat"
2559,"And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, 			 			 and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went 			 			 into the holy place, and shall leave them there"
2560,And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. 
2561,"And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his 			 			 clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the 			 			 camp. "
2562,"And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin 			 			 offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy 			 			 place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in 			 			 the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. "
2563,"And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his 			 			 flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. "
2564,And this shall be a statute for ever unto you
2565,"It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict 			 			 your souls, by a statute for ever. "
2566,"And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall 			 			 consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, 			 			 shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the 			 			 holy garments"
2567,"And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an 			 			 atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. 			 			 And he did as the LORD commanded Moses. "
2568,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2569,"And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the 			 			 LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the 			 			 fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD. "
2570,"And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after 			 			 whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto 			 			 them throughout their generations. "
2571,"And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the 			 			 house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that 			 			 offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, "
2572,"And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the 			 			 strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I 			 			 will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will 			 			 cut him off from among his people. "
2573,For the life of the flesh is in the blood
2574,"Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you 			 			 shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you 			 			 eat blood. "
2575,"And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the 			 			 strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast 			 			 or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, 			 			 and cover it with dust. "
2576,For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life 			 			 thereof
2577,"And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that 			 			 which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or 			 			 a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in 			 			 water, and be unclean until the even"
2578,"But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear 			 			 his iniquity. "
2579,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2580,"After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye 			 			 not do"
2581,"Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk 			 			 therein"

2595,"Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to 			 			 uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time. "
2596,"Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her 			 			 nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness. "
2597,"Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, 			 			 to defile thyself with her. "
2598,"And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to 			 			 Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God"

2600,Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself 			 			 therewith
2601,Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things
2602,"Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall 			 			 not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, 			 			 nor any stranger that sojourneth among you"
2603,"For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the 			 			 souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people. "
2604,"Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any 			 			 one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and 			 			 that ye defile not yourselves therein"
2605,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2606,"Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my 			 			 sabbaths"
2607,"Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods"
2608,"And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye 			 			 shall offer it at your own will. "
2609,"It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow"
2610,"And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it 			 			 shall not be accepted. "
2611,"Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, 			 			 because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD"
2612,"And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly 			 			 reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings 			 			 of thy harvest. "

2701,"Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your 			 			 God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and 			 			 blemishes be in them"
2702,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2703,"And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her 			 			 young both in one day. "

2723,"And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits 			 			 for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs"
2724,"And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an 			 			 holy convocation unto you"
2725,"And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make 			 			 clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither 			 			 shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest"

2727,Ye shall do no servile work therein
2728,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2729,And ye shall do no work in that same day
2730,"For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that 			 			 same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. "
2731,"And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, 			 			 the same soul will I destroy from among his people. "

2774,"Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do 			 			 them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. "
2775,"And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, 			 			 and dwell therein in safety. "
2776,"And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, 			 			 we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase"
2777,"And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until 			 			 the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old 			 			 store. "
2778,The land shall not be sold for ever
2779,And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a 			 			 redemption for the land. 
2780,"If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his 			 			 possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he 			 			 redeem that which his brother sold. "
2781,"And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to 			 			 redeem it; "
2782,"But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is 			 			 sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the 			 			 year of jubile"
2783,"And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may 			 			 redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may 			 			 he redeem it. "
2784,"And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then 			 			 the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to 			 			 him that bought it throughout his generations"
2785,But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about 			 			 them shall be counted as the fields of the country
2786,"Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the 			 			 cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. "
2787,"And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was 			 			 sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of 			 			 jubile"
2788,But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; 			 			 for it is their perpetual possession. 
2789,"And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; 			 			 then thou shalt relieve him"
2790,"Take thou no usury of him, or increase"
2791,"Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy 			 			 victuals for increase. "
2792,"I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land 			 			 of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God. "
2793,"And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be 			 			 sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant"
2794,"And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children 			 			 with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the 			 			 possession of his fathers shall he return. "
2795,"For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land 			 			 of Egypt"
2796,Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy 			 			 God. 
2797,"Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, 			 			 shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy 			 			 bondmen and bondmaids. "
2798,"Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among 			 			 you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, 			 			 which they begat in your land"
2799,"And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after 			 			 you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for 			 			 ever"
2800,"And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother 			 			 that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or 			 			 sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family"
2801,And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that 			 			 he was sold to him unto the year of jubile
2802,"If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall 			 			 give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was 			 			 bought for. "
2803,"And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then 			 			 he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give 			 			 him again the price of his redemption. "
2804,And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him
2805,"And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out 			 			 in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him. "
2806,For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my 			 			 servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt
2807,"Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up 			 			 a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your 			 			 land, to bow down unto it"
2808,"Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary"
2809,"If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 			 			 "
2810,"And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage 			 			 shall reach unto the sowing time"
2811,"And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and 			 			 none shall make you afraid"
2812,"And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you 			 			 by the sword. "
2813,"And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you 			 			 shall put ten thousand to flight"
2814,"For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and 			 			 multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. "
2815,"And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of 			 			 the new. "
2816,And I set my tabernacle among you
2817,"And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be 			 			 my people. "
2818,"I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land 			 			 of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the 			 			 bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. "
2819,"But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these 			 			 commandments; "
2820,"And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before 			 			 your enemies"
2821,"And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will 			 			 punish you seven times more for your sins. "
2822,"And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your 			 			 heaven as iron, and your earth as brass"
2823,"And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I 			 			 will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. "
2824,"I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of 			 			 your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; 			 			 and your high ways shall be desolate. "
2825,"And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will 			 			 walk contrary unto me; "
2826,"And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel 			 			 of my covenant"
2827,"And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall 			 			 bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread 			 			 again by weight"
2828,"And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk 			 			 contrary unto me; "
2829,"And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your 			 			 daughters shall ye eat. "
2830,"And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, 			 			 and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul 			 			 shall abhor you. "
2831,"And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries 			 			 unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. "
2832,And I will bring the land into desolation
2833,"And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a 			 			 sword after you"
2834,"Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth 			 			 desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land 			 			 rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. "
2835,"As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not 			 			 rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. "
2836,"And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness 			 			 into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a 			 			 shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a 			 			 sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. "
2837,"And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, 			 			 when none pursueth"
2838,"And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your 			 			 enemies shall eat you up. "
2839,And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity 			 			 in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers 			 			 shall they pine away with them. 
2840,"If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their 			 			 fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and 			 			 that also they have walked contrary unto me; "
2841,"The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her 			 			 sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them"
2842,"And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, 			 			 I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them 			 			 utterly, and to break my covenant with them"
2843,"But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their 			 			 ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight 			 			 of the heathen, that I might be their God"
2844,"These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD 			 			 made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand 			 			 of Moses. "
2845,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2846,"And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old 			 			 even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels 			 			 of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. "
2847,"And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty 			 			 shekels. "
2848,"And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then 			 			 thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female 			 			 ten shekels. "
2849,"And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy 			 			 estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the 			 			 female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. "
2850,"And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, 			 			 then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten 			 			 shekels. "
2851,"But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present 			 			 himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according 			 			 to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. "
2852,"And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the 			 			 LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy. "
2853,"He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad 			 			 for a good"
2854,"And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a 			 			 sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the 			 			 priest"
2855,"But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part 			 			 thereof unto thy estimation. "
2856,"And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the 			 			 LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad"
2857,"And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he 			 			 shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and 			 			 it shall be his. "
2858,"And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field 			 			 of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed 			 			 thereof"
2859,"If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to 			 			 thy estimation it shall stand. "
2860,"But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest 			 			 shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, 			 			 even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy 			 			 estimation. "
2861,"And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, 			 			 then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto 			 			 it, and it shall be assured to him. "
2862,"And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the 			 			 field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. "
2863,"But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy 			 			 unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the 			 			 priest's. "
2864,"And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath 			 			 bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; "
2865,"In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of 			 			 whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did 			 			 belong. "
2866,And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the 			 			 sanctuary
2867,"Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's 			 			 firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep"
2868,"And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it 			 			 according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it 			 			 thereto"
2869,"Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto 			 			 the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field 			 			 of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed"
2870,"None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; 			 			 but shall surely be put to death. "
2871,"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, 			 			 or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's"
2872,"And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall 			 			 add thereto the fifth part thereof. "
2873,"And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of 			 			 whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the 			 			 LORD. "
2874,"He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he 			 			 change it"
2875,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, 			 			 in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, 			 			 saying, "
2876,And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head 			 			 of the house of his fathers.

2976,"All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron 			 			 numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, 			 			 all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two 			 			 thousand. "
2977,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the 			 			 males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take 			 			 the number of their names. "
2978,And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of 			 			 all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the 			 			 Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children 			 			 of Israel. 
2979,"And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn 			 			 among the children of Israel. "
2980,"And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month 			 			 old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and 			 			 two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. "
2981,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2982,"And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and 			 			 threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, 			 			 which are more than the Levites; "
2983,And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and 			 			 above them that were redeemed by the Levites
2984,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, "
2985,"This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle 			 			 of the congregation, about the most holy things"
2986,"And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, 			 			 and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers 			 			 to cover withal"
2987,"And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of 			 			 the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all 			 			 the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it"
2988,"And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and 			 			 cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the 			 			 staves thereof"
2989,"And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the 			 			 sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set 			 			 forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it"
2990,"And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest 			 			 pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily 			 			 meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the 			 			 tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the 			 			 vessels thereof. "
2991,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying, "
2992,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
2993,"This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, 			 			 and for burdens"
2994,"At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service 			 			 of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their 			 			 service"
2995,This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation
2996,"As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their 			 			 families, by the house of their fathers; "
2997,"And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their 			 			 service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the 			 			 tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets 			 			 thereof, "
2998,"This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, 			 			 according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, 			 			 under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. "
2999,"And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered 			 			 the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house 			 			 of their fathers, "
3000,"These were they that were numbered of the families of the 			 			 Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the 			 			 commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. "
3001,"And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout 			 			 their families, and by the house of their fathers, "
3002,"These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of 			 			 Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the 			 			 commandment of the LORD. "
3003,"And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of 			 			 Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, "
3004,"These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of 			 			 Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the 			 			 LORD by the hand of Moses. "
3005,"All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron 			 			 and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the 			 			 house of their fathers, "
3006,"Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and 			 			 five hundred and fourscore, "
3007,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3008,"And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the 			 			 camp"
3009,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3010,"But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, 			 			 let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; 			 			 beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made 			 			 for him. "
3011,"And every offering of all the holy things of the children of 			 			 Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his. "
3012,And every man's hallowed things shall be his
3013,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3014,"And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD"
3015,"And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall 			 			 blot them out with the bitter water"
3016,"Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the 			 			 woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer 			 			 it upon the altar"
3017,"And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come 			 			 to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her 			 			 husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, 			 			 and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot"
3018,"And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be 			 			 free, and shall conceive seed. "
3019,"This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another 			 			 instead of her husband, and is defiled; "
3020,"Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman 			 			 shall bear her iniquity. "
3021,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3022,"All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made 			 			 of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk. "
3023,All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor 			 			 come upon his head
3024,All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall 			 			 come at no dead body. 
3025,"He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his 			 			 mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die"
3026,All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD. 
3027,"And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the 			 			 head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of 			 			 his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. "
3028,"And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young 			 			 pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation"
3029,"And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, 			 			 and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering"
3030,"And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his 			 			 separation are fulfilled"
3031,"And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer 			 			 his sin offering, and his burnt offering"
3032,"And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the 			 			 door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of 			 			 the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the 			 			 sacrifice of the peace offerings. "
3033,"And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one 			 			 unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall 			 			 put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his 			 			 separation is shaven"
3034,"This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his 			 			 offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand 			 			 shall get"
3035,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3036,"And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I 			 			 will bless them. "
3037,"And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the 			 			 tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the 			 			 instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and 			 			 had anointed them, and sanctified them; "
3038,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3039,"And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the 			 			 Levites. "
3040,"Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, 			 			 according to their service"
3041,But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none
3042,"And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day 			 			 that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before 			 			 the altar. "
3043,"And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, 			 			 each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar. "
3044,"And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the 			 			 son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah"
3045,"On the second day Nethaneel the son of Zuar, prince of Issachar, 			 			 did offer"
3046,"On the third day Eliab the son of Helon, prince of the children 			 			 of Zebulun, did offer"
3047,"On the fourth day Elizur the son of Shedeur, prince of the 			 			 children of Reuben, did offer"
3048,"On the fifth day Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai, prince of the 			 			 children of Simeon, did offer"
3049,"On the sixth day Eliasaph the son of Deuel, prince of the 			 			 children of Gad, offered"
3050,"On the seventh day Elishama the son of Ammihud, prince of the 			 			 children of Ephraim, offered"
3051,"On the eighth day offered Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur, prince of 			 			 the children of Manasseh"
3052,"On the ninth day Abidan the son of Gideoni, prince of the 			 			 children of Benjamin, offered"
3053,"On the tenth day Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, prince of the 			 			 children of Dan, offered"
3054,"On the eleventh day Pagiel the son of Ocran, prince of the 			 			 children of Asher, offered"
3055,"On the twelfth day Ahira the son of Enan, prince of the children 			 			 of Naphtali, offered"
3056,"This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was 			 			 anointed, by the princes of Israel"
3057,"All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the 			 			 rams twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat 			 			 offering"
3058,"And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were 			 			 twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the 			 			 lambs of the first year sixty. This was the dedication of the altar, 			 			 after that it was anointed. "
3059,"And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation 			 			 to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him 			 			 from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from 			 			 between the two cherubims"
3060,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3061,"And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the 			 			 candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses. "
3062,"And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the 			 			 shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work"
3063,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3064,"And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them"
3065,"Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even 			 			 fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take 			 			 for a sin offering. "
3066,And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation
3067,And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the 			 			 bullocks
3068,"And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, 			 			 and offer them for an offering unto the LORD. "
3069,Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of 			 			 Israel
3070,And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation
3071,"For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of 			 			 Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the 			 			 firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. "
3072,"For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both 			 			 man and beast"
3073,And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the 			 			 children of Israel. 
3074,"And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons 			 			 from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children 			 			 of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an 			 			 atonement for the children of Israel"
3075,"And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of 			 			 Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded 			 			 Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. "
3076,"And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and 			 			 Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an 			 			 atonement for them to cleanse them. "
3077,"And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons"
3078,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3079,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the 			 			 first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of 			 			 Egypt, saying, "
3080,"In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in 			 			 his appointed season"
3081,"And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep 			 			 the passover. "
3082,And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first 			 			 month at even in the wilderness of Sinai
3083,"And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a 			 			 man, that they could not keep the passover on that day"
3084,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3085,"The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep 			 			 it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. "
3086,"They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone 			 			 of it"
3087,"But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and 			 			 forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off 			 			 from among his people"
3088,"And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the 			 			 passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, 			 			 and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do"
3089,"And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud 			 			 covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony"
3090,So it was alway
3091,"And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after 			 			 that the children of Israel journeyed"
3092,"At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, 			 			 and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched"
3093,"And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, 			 			 then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed 			 			 not. "
3094,"And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; 			 			 according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, 			 			 and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. "
3095,"And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, 			 			 and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed"
3096,"Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the 			 			 cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of 			 			 Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not"
3097,"At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at 			 			 the commandment of the LORD they journeyed"
3098,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3099,"And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall 			 			 assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation. "
3100,"And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which 			 			 are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto 			 			 thee. "
3101,"When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts 			 			 shall go forward. "
3102,"When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on 			 			 the south side shall take their journey"
3103,"But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall 			 			 blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. "
3104,"And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; 			 			 and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your 			 			 generations. "
3105,"And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that 			 			 oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye 			 			 shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved 			 			 from your enemies. "
3106,"Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and 			 			 in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over 			 			 your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; 			 			 that they may be to you for a memorial before your God"
3107,"And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in 			 			 the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle 			 			 of the testimony. "
3108,And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the 			 			 wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran. 
3109,And they first took their journey according to the commandment 			 			 of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 
3110,In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children 			 			 of Judah according to their armies
3111,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was 			 			 Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 
3112,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was 			 			 Eliab the son of Helon. 
3113,"And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and 			 			 the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle. "
3114,And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to 			 			 their armies
3115,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was 			 			 Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 
3116,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was 			 			 Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 
3117,"And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary"
3118,And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set 			 			 forward according to their armies
3119,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was 			 			 Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
3120,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was 			 			 Abidan the son of Gideoni. 
3121,"And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, 			 			 which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts"
3122,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was 			 			 Pagiel the son of Ocran. 
3123,And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was 			 			 Ahira the son of Enan. 
3124,"Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to 			 			 their armies, when they set forward. "
3125,"And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, 			 			 Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the 			 			 LORD said, I will give it you"
3126,"And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine 			 			 own land, and to my kindred. "
3127,"And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou 			 			 knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to 			 			 us instead of eyes. "
3128,"And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what 			 			 goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee. "
3129,And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' 			 			 journey
3130,"And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went 			 			 out of the camp. "
3131,"And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, 			 			 Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that 			 			 hate thee flee before thee. "
3132,"And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many 			 			 thousands of Israel. "
3133,"And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD"
3134,"And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the 			 			 LORD, the fire was quenched. "
3135,And he called the name of the place Taberah
3136,And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting
3137,"And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as 			 			 the colour of bdellium. "
3138,"And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in 			 			 mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of 			 			 it"
3139,"And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell 			 			 upon it. "
3140,"Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, 			 			 every man in the door of his tent"
3141,"And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy 			 			 servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou 			 			 layest the burden of all this people upon me? "
3142,"I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too 			 			 heavy for me. "
3143,"And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of 			 			 hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my 			 			 wretchedness. "
3144,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the 			 			 elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, 			 			 and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation, that they may stand there with thee. "
3145,And I will come down and talk with thee there
3146,"And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to 			 			 morrow, and ye shall eat flesh"
3147,"Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither 			 			 ten days, nor twenty days; "
3148,"Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice 			 			 them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, 			 			 to suffice them? "
3149,"And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, 			 			 and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them 			 			 round about the tabernacle. "
3150,"And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took 			 			 of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders"
3151,"But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the 			 			 one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad"
3152,"And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and 			 			 Medad do prophesy in the camp. "
3153,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his 			 			 young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. "
3154,"And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God 			 			 that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put 			 			 his spirit upon them! "
3155,"And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails 			 			 from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's 			 			 journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other 			 			 side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the 			 			 face of the earth. "
3156,"And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and 			 			 all the next day, and they gathered the quails"
3157,"And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was 			 			 chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the 			 			 LORD smote the people with a very great plague. "
3158,And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah
3159,And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; 			 			 and abode at Hazeroth. 
3160,And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian 			 			 woman whom he had married
3161,"And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he 			 			 not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it. "
3162,"(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were 			 			 upon the face of the earth.) "
3163,"And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in 			 			 the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam"
3164,"And he said, Hear now my words"
3165,"My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. "
3166,"With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in 			 			 dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold"
3167,"And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, 			 			 Miriam became leprous, white as snow"
3168,"And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay 			 			 not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we 			 			 have sinned. "
3169,"Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed 			 			 when he cometh out of his mother's womb. "
3170,"And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I 			 			 beseech thee. "
3171,"And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her 			 			 face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from 			 			 the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again. "
3172,And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days
3173,"And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in 			 			 the wilderness of Paran. "
3174,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3175,And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the 			 			 wilderness of Paran
3176,And these were their names
3177,"Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. "
3178,"Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. "
3179,"Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. "
3180,"Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. "
3181,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. "
3182,"Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. "
3183,"Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi 			 			 the son of Susi. "
3184,"Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. "
3185,"Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. "
3186,"Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. "
3187,"Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. "
3188,These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the 			 			 land. 
3189,"And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto 			 			 them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain"
3190,"So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of 			 			 Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. "
3191,"And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where 			 			 Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron 			 			 was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) "
3192,"The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of 			 			 grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. "
3193,And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. 
3194,"And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the 			 			 congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, 			 			 to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the 			 			 congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. "
3195,"And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou 			 			 sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the 			 			 fruit of it. "
3196,"Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and 			 			 the cities are walled, and very great"
3197,The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south
3198,"And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go 			 			 up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. "
3199,"But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up 			 			 against the people; for they are stronger than we. "
3200,"And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had 			 			 searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which 			 			 we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants 			 			 thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great 			 			 stature. "
3201,"And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the 			 			 giants"
3202,"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and 			 			 the people wept that night. "
3203,And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against 			 			 Aaron
3204,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly 			 			 of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
3205,"And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which 			 			 were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes"
3206,"If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, 			 			 and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. "
3207,"Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of 			 			 the land; for they are bread for us"
3208,But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the 			 			 glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation 			 			 before all the children of Israel. 
3209,"And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke 			 			 me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs 			 			 which I have shewed among them? "
3210,"And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, 			 			 (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) 			 			 "
3211,"Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the 			 			 nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, "
3212,"And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great, 			 			 according as thou hast spoken, saying, "
3213,"Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according 			 			 unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this 			 			 people, from Egypt even until now. "
3214,"And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word"
3215,"Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, 			 			 which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now 			 			 these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; "
3216,"(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) 			 			 Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the 			 			 Red sea. "
3217,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, "
3218,"Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have 			 			 spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you"
3219,"Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I 			 			 sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and 			 			 Joshua the son of Nun. "
3220,"But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will 			 			 I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. "
3221,"But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this 			 			 wilderness. "
3222,"And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, 			 			 and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the 			 			 wilderness. "
3223,"After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even 			 			 forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even 			 			 forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. "
3224,"I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil 			 			 congregation, that are gathered together against me"
3225,"And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, 			 			 and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a 			 			 slander upon the land, "
3226,"But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which 			 			 were of the men that went to search the land, lived still. "
3227,And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel
3228,"And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the 			 			 top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the 			 			 place which the LORD hath promised"
3229,"And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment 			 			 of the LORD? but it shall not prosper. "
3230,"Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten 			 			 before your enemies. "
3231,"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and 			 			 ye shall fall by the sword"
3232,But they presumed to go up unto the hill top
3233,"Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in 			 			 that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah. "
3234,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3235,"And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt 			 			 thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. "
3236,"Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth 			 			 deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil. "
3237,"And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an 			 			 hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. "
3238,"And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a 			 			 sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD"
3239,"And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, 			 			 for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. "
3240,"Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a 			 			 lamb, or a kid. "
3241,"According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to 			 			 every one according to their number. "
3242,"All that are born of the country shall do these things after 			 			 this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour 			 			 unto the LORD. "
3243,"And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in 			 			 your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet 			 			 savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do. "
3244,"One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and 			 			 also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever 			 			 in your generations"
3245,"One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger 			 			 that sojourneth with you. "
3246,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3247,Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave 			 			 offering
3248,Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave 			 			 offering in your generations. 
3249,"And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, 			 			 which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, "
3250,"And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation 			 			 of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is 			 			 ignorance"
3251,"And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she 			 			 goat of the first year for a sin offering. "
3252,"And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth 			 			 ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an 			 			 atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him. "
3253,"Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, 			 			 both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the 			 			 stranger that sojourneth among them. "
3254,"But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born 			 			 in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that 			 			 soul shall be cut off from among his people. "
3255,"Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken 			 			 his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity 			 			 shall be upon him. "
3256,"And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they 			 			 found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. "
3257,"And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses 			 			 and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. "
3258,"And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what 			 			 should be done to him. "
3259,"And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to 			 			 death"
3260,"And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and 			 			 stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses. "
3261,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3262,"I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of 			 			 Egypt, to be your God"
3263,"Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, 			 			 and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, 			 			 sons of Reuben, took men"
3264,"This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; "
3265,"And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi"
3266,"And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not 			 			 thou their offering"
3267,"And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before 			 			 the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow"
3268,"And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and 			 			 laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation with Moses and Aaron. "
3269,And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the 			 			 door of the tabernacle of the congregation
3270,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, "
3271,"And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the 			 			 spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with 			 			 all the congregation? "
3272,And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the 			 			 elders of Israel followed him. 
3273,"And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, 			 			 from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest 			 			 ye be consumed in all their sins. "
3274,"So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, 			 			 on every side"
3275,"And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me 			 			 to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. "
3276,"If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be 			 			 visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent 			 			 me. "
3277,"But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, 			 			 and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go 			 			 down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have 			 			 provoked the LORD. "
3278,"And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these 			 			 words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them"
3279,"They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the 			 			 pit, and the earth closed upon them"
3280,And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of 			 			 them
3281,"And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two 			 			 hundred and fifty men that offered incense. "
3282,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3283,"The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them 			 			 make them broad plates for a covering of the altar"
3284,"And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they 			 			 that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a 			 			 covering of the altar"
3285,"But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel 			 			 murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the 			 			 people of the LORD. "
3286,"And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against 			 			 Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation"
3287,And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation. 
3288,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3289,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein 			 			 from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the 			 			 congregation, and make an atonement for them"
3290,"And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the 			 			 congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people"
3291,And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was 			 			 stayed. 
3292,"Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and 			 			 seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah. "
3293,And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of 			 			 the congregation
3294,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3295,And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi
3296,"And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation 			 			 before the testimony, where I will meet with you. "
3297,"And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall 			 			 choose, shall blossom"
3298,"And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of 			 			 their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to 			 			 their fathers' houses, even twelve rods"
3299,And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of 			 			 witness. 
3300,"And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the 			 			 tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of 			 			 Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and 			 			 yielded almonds. "
3301,And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all 			 			 the children of Israel
3302,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the 			 			 testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt 			 			 quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. "
3303,And Moses did so
3304,"And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we 			 			 die, we perish, we all perish. "
3305,Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD 			 			 shall die
3306,"And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy 			 			 father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and 			 			 minister unto thee"
3307,"And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the 			 			 tabernacle"
3308,"And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle"
3309,"And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of 			 			 the altar"
3310,"And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among 			 			 the children of Israel"
3311,"Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's 			 			 office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall 			 			 serve"
3312,"And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the 			 			 charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the 			 			 children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the 			 			 anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. "
3313,"This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the 			 			 fire"
3314,In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat 			 			 it
3315,"And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all 			 			 the wave offerings of the children of Israel"
3316,"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of 			 			 the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the 			 			 LORD, them have I given thee. "
3317,"And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring 			 			 unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house 			 			 shall eat of it. "
3318,Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 
3319,"Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they 			 			 bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine"
3320,"And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou 			 			 redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, 			 			 after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. "
3321,"But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the 			 			 firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy"
3322,"And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as 			 			 the right shoulder are thine. "
3323,"All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children 			 			 of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy 			 			 daughters with thee, by a statute for ever"
3324,"And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in 			 			 their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them"
3325,"And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in 			 			 Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even 			 			 the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. "
3326,"Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. "
3327,"But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the 			 			 congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity"
3328,"But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an 			 			 heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit"
3329,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3330,"And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as 			 			 though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of 			 			 the winepress. "
3331,"Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all 			 			 your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall 			 			 give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest. "
3332,"Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the 			 			 LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of 			 			 it. "
3333,"Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best 			 			 thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the 			 			 increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. "
3334,"And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households"
3335,"And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved 			 			 from it the best of it"
3336,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, "
3337,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his 			 			 flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the 			 			 priest shall be unclean until the even. "
3338,"And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and 			 			 bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. "
3339,"And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, 			 			 and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be 			 			 kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of 			 			 separation"
3340,"And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his 			 			 clothes, and be unclean until the even"
3341,He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven 			 			 days. 
3342,"He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the 			 			 seventh day he shall be clean"
3343,"Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and 			 			 purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that 			 			 soul shall be cut off from Israel"
3344,"This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent"
3345,"And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is 			 			 unclean. "
3346,"And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the 			 			 open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be 			 			 unclean seven days. "
3347,"And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the 			 			 burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put 			 			 thereto in a vessel"
3348,"But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, 			 			 that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he 			 			 hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD"
3349,"And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that 			 			 sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that 			 			 toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. "
3350,And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and 			 			 the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even. 
3351,"Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, 			 			 into the desert of Zin in the first month"
3352,And there was no water for the congregation
3353,"And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God 			 			 that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! "
3354,"And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto 			 			 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon 			 			 their faces"
3355,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3356,"And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. "
3357,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before 			 			 the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch 			 			 you water out of this rock? "
3358,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me 			 			 not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore 			 			 ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given 			 			 them. "
3359,"This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel 			 			 strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them. "
3360,"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, 			 			 Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath 			 			 befallen us"
3361,"And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come 			 			 out against thee with the sword. "
3362,"And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high 			 			 way"
3363,"And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out 			 			 against him with much people, and with a strong hand. "
3364,Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border
3365,"And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, 			 			 journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. "
3366,"And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the 			 			 coast of the land of Edom, saying, "
3367,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount 			 			 Hor"
3368,And Moses did as the LORD commanded
3369,"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon 			 			 Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount"
3370,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they 			 			 mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. "
3371,"And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard 			 			 tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against 			 			 Israel, and took some of them prisoners. "
3372,"And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt 			 			 indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy 			 			 their cities. "
3373,"And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up 			 			 the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities"
3374,"And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to 			 			 compass the land of Edom"
3375,"And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore 			 			 have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there 			 			 is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this 			 			 light bread. "
3376,"And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit 			 			 the people; and much people of Israel died. "
3377,"Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for 			 			 we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, 			 			 that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the 			 			 people. "
3378,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set 			 			 it upon a pole"
3379,"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it 			 			 came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the 			 			 serpent of brass, he lived. "
3380,"And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. "
3381,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the 			 			 wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. "
3382,"From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. "
3383,"From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of 			 			 Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the 			 			 Amorites"
3384,"Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What 			 			 he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, "
3385,And from thence they went to Beer
3386,"Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it"
3387,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, 			 			 saying, "
3388,And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border
3389,"And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed 			 			 his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon"
3390,And Israel took all these cities
3391,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who 			 			 had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out 			 			 of his hand, even unto Arnon. "
3392,"Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, 			 			 let the city of Sihon be built and prepared"
3393,"Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh"
3394,"We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and 			 			 we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba. "
3395,Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
3396,"And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages 			 			 thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. "
3397,And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan
3398,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not"
3399,"So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there 			 			 was none left him alive"
3400,"And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains 			 			 of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho. "
3401,And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the 			 			 Amorites. 
3402,"And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many"
3403,"And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company 			 			 lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of 			 			 the field. "
3404,"He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to 			 			 Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his 			 			 people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from 			 			 Egypt"
3405,"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the 			 			 rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and 			 			 spake unto him the words of Balak. "
3406,"And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring 			 			 you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me"
3407,"And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? 			 			 "
3408,"And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou 			 			 shalt not curse the people"
3409,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of 			 			 Balak, Get you into your land"
3410,"And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and 			 			 said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. "
3411,"And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than 			 			 they. "
3412,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the 			 			 son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto 			 			 me"
3413,"And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If 			 			 Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go 			 			 beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. "
3414,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I 			 			 may know what the LORD will say unto me more. "
3415,"And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men 			 			 come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I 			 			 shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. "
3416,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went 			 			 with the princes of Moab. "
3417,And God's anger was kindled because he went
3418,"And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and 			 			 his sword drawn in his hand"
3419,"But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a 			 			 wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. "
3420,"And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself 			 			 unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall"
3421,"And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow 			 			 place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the 			 			 left. "
3422,"And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under 			 			 Balaam"
3423,"And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto 			 			 Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these 			 			 three times? "
3424,"And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which 			 			 thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont 			 			 to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. "
3425,"Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of 			 			 the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand"
3426,"And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou 			 			 smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand 			 			 thee, because thy way is perverse before me"
3427,"And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I 			 			 knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me"
3428,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men"
3429,"And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet 			 			 him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in 			 			 the utmost coast. "
3430,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee 			 			 to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed 			 			 to promote thee to honour? "
3431,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth. "
3432,"And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the 			 			 princes that were with him. "
3433,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and 			 			 brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see 			 			 the utmost part of the people. "
3434,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and 			 			 prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. "
3435,And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered 			 			 on every altar a bullock and a ram. 
3436,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I 			 			 will go"
3437,And God met Balaam
3438,"And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto 			 			 Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. "
3439,"And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt 			 			 sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab. "
3440,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath 			 			 brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, 			 			 curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. "
3441,"How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, 			 			 whom the LORD hath not defied? "
3442,"Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth 			 			 part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last 			 			 end be like his! "
3443,"And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that 			 			 which the LORD hath put in my mouth? "
3444,"And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of 			 			 Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on 			 			 every altar. "
3445,"And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while 			 			 I meet the LORD yonder. "
3446,"And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, 			 			 Go again unto Balak, and say thus. "
3447,"And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, 			 			 and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath 			 			 the LORD spoken? "
3448,"He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen 			 			 perverseness in Israel"
3449,God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength 			 			 of an unicorn. 
3450,"Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there 			 			 any divination against Israel"
3451,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless 			 			 them at all. "
3452,"But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, 			 			 saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do? "
3453,"And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh 			 			 toward Jeshimon. "
3454,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and 			 			 prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. "
3455,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a 			 			 ram on every altar. "
3456,"And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he 			 			 went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his 			 			 face toward the wilderness. "
3457,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his 			 			 tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. "
3458,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath 			 			 said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said"
3459,"He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be 			 			 in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his 			 			 kingdom shall be exalted. "
3460,God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the 			 			 strength of an unicorn
3461,"He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion"
3462,"And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his 			 			 hands together"
3463,Therefore now flee thou to thy place
3464,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers 			 			 which thou sentest unto me, saying, "
3465,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor 			 			 hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said"
3466,"And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession 			 			 for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. "
3467,"Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall 			 			 destroy him that remaineth of the city. "
3468,"And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, 			 			 Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that 			 			 he perish for ever. "
3469,"And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, 			 			 Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. "
3470,"Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall 			 			 carry thee away captive. "
3471,"And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when 			 			 God doeth this! "
3472,"And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place"
3473,"And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit 			 			 whoredom with the daughters of Moab. "
3474,And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods
3475,And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor
3476,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, 			 			 and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce 			 			 anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel. "
3477,"And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his 			 			 men that were joined unto Baalpeor. "
3478,"And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto 			 			 his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the 			 			 sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were 			 			 weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. "
3479,"And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the 			 			 priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a 			 			 javelin in his hand; "
3480,And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. 
3481,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3482,"Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace"
3483,"Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was 			 			 slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince 			 			 of a chief house among the Simeonites. "
3484,"And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, 			 			 the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house 			 			 in Midian. "
3485,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3486,"And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto 			 			 Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, "
3487,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of 			 			 Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, "
3488,"Reuben, the eldest son of Israel"
3489,These are the families of the Reubenites
3490,And the sons of Pallu; Eliab. 
3491,"And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is 			 			 that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who 			 			 strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when 			 			 they strove against the LORD"
3492,Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not. 
3493,The sons of Simeon after their families
3494,"These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two 			 			 thousand and two hundred. "
3495,The children of Gad after their families
3496,"These are the families of the children of Gad according to those 			 			 that were numbered of them, forty thousand and five hundred. "
3497,The sons of Judah were Er and Onan
3498,"And the sons of Judah after their families were; of Shelah, the 			 			 family of the Shelanites"
3499,"And the sons of Pharez were; of Hezron, the family of the 			 			 Hezronites"
3500,"These are the families of Judah according to those that were 			 			 numbered of them, threescore and sixteen thousand and five hundred. "
3501,Of the sons of Issachar after their families
3502,"These are the families of Issachar according to those that were 			 			 numbered of them, threescore and four thousand and three hundred. "
3503,Of the sons of Zebulun after their families
3504,"These are the families of the Zebulunites according to those 			 			 that were numbered of them, threescore thousand and five hundred. "
3505,The sons of Joseph after their families were Manasseh and 			 			 Ephraim. 
3506,Of the sons of Manasseh
3507,These are the sons of Gilead
3508,"And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters"
3509,"These are the families of Manasseh, and those that were numbered 			 			 of them, fifty and two thousand and seven hundred. "
3510,These are the sons of Ephraim after their families
3511,And these are the sons of Shuthelah
3512,"These are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those 			 			 that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and five hundred. 			 			 These are the sons of Joseph after their families. "
3513,The sons of Benjamin after their families
3514,And the sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman
3515,These are the sons of Benjamin after their families
3516,These are the sons of Dan after their families
3517,"All the families of the Shuhamites, according to those that were 			 			 numbered of them, were threescore and four thousand and four hundred. "
3518,Of the children of Asher after their families
3519,Of the sons of Beriah
3520,And the name of the daughter of Asher was Sarah. 
3521,These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those 			 			 that were numbered of them; who were fifty and three thousand and four 			 			 hundred. 
3522,Of the sons of Naphtali after their families
3523,These are the families of Naphtali according to their families
3524,"These were the numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred 			 			 thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty. "
3525,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3526,"To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou 			 			 shalt give the less inheritance"
3527,Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot
3528,According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided 			 			 between many and few. 
3529,And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their 			 			 families
3530,These are the families of the Levites
3531,"And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, 			 			 whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt"
3532,"And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. "
3533,"And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before 			 			 the LORD. "
3534,"And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three 			 			 thousand, all males from a month old and upward"
3535,"These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the 			 			 priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by 			 			 Jordan near Jericho. "
3536,"But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron 			 			 the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the 			 			 wilderness of Sinai. "
3537,"For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the 			 			 wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son 			 			 of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. "
3538,"Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son 			 			 of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of 			 			 Manasseh the son of Joseph"
3539,"And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and 			 			 before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the 			 			 tabernacle of the congregation, saying, "
3540,"Why should the name of our father be done away from among his 			 			 family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession 			 			 among the brethren of our father. "
3541,And Moses brought their cause before the LORD. 
3542,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3543,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a 			 			 man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass 			 			 unto his daughter. "
3544,"And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance 			 			 unto his brethren. "
3545,"And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance 			 			 unto his father's brethren. "
3546,"And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his 			 			 inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he 			 			 shall possess it"
3547,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount 			 			 Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of 			 			 Israel. "
3548,"And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy 			 			 people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. "
3549,"For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in 			 			 the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before 			 			 their eyes"
3550,"And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, "
3551,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a 			 			 man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; "
3552,"And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the 			 			 congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. "
3553,"And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask 			 			 counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD"
3554,And Moses did as the LORD commanded him
3555,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3556,"And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire 			 			 which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year 			 			 without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering. "
3557,"The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb 			 			 shalt thou offer at even; "
3558,"It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount 			 			 Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. "
3559,And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin 			 			 for the one lamb
3560,And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even
3561,"And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, 			 			 and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, 			 			 and the drink offering thereof"
3562,"And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt 			 			 offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs 			 			 of the first year without spot; "
3563,"And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a 			 			 bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of 			 			 an hin unto a lamb"
3564,"And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall 			 			 be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink 			 			 offering. "
3565,And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of 			 			 the LORD. 
3566,And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast
3567,In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no 			 			 manner of servile work therein
3568,"Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, 			 			 which is for a continual burnt offering. "
3569,"After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven 			 			 days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto 			 			 the LORD"
3570,And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye 			 			 shall do no servile work. 
3571,"Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat 			 			 offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy 			 			 convocation; ye shall do no servile work"
3572,"Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his 			 			 meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their 			 			 drink offerings. "
3573,"And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall 			 			 have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work"
3574,"And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the 			 			 LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year 			 			 without blemish"
3575,And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy 			 			 convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls
3576,"And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an 			 			 holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a 			 			 feast unto the LORD seven days"
3577,"And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks, two 			 			 rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot"
3578,"And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs 			 			 of the first year without blemish; "
3579,"And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs 			 			 of the first year without blemish"
3580,"And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs 			 			 of the first year without spot"
3581,"And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen 			 			 lambs of the first year without blemish"
3582,"And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen 			 			 lambs of the first year without blemish"
3583,On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly
3584,"These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts, 			 			 beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt 			 			 offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, 			 			 and for your peace offerings. "
3585,And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the 			 			 LORD commanded Moses. 
3586,"And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the 			 			 children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath 			 			 commanded. "
3587,"If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his 			 			 soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according 			 			 to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. "
3588,"If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a 			 			 bond, being in her father's house in her youth; "
3589,"But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not 			 			 any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, 			 			 shall stand"
3590,"And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered 			 			 ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; "
3591,"But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; 			 			 then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered 			 			 with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect"
3592,"But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith 			 			 they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. "
3593,"And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a 			 			 bond with an oath; "
3594,"But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he 			 			 heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her 			 			 vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand"
3595,"Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her 			 			 husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. "
3596,"But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to 			 			 day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are 			 			 upon her"
3597,But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard 			 			 them; then he shall bear her iniquity. 
3598,"These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between 			 			 a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in 			 			 her youth in her father's house. "
3599,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3600,"And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves 			 			 unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the 			 			 LORD of Midian. "
3601,"Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, 			 			 shall ye send to the war. "
3602,"So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a 			 			 thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. "
3603,"And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them 			 			 and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy 			 			 instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. "
3604,"And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded 			 			 Moses; and they slew all the males. "
3605,"And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that 			 			 were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five 			 			 kings of Midian"
3606,"And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, 			 			 and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all 			 			 their flocks, and all their goods. "
3607,"And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all 			 			 their goodly castles, with fire. "
3608,"And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and 			 			 of beasts. "
3609,"And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto 			 			 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the 			 			 children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by 			 			 Jordan near Jericho. "
3610,"And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the 			 			 congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. "
3611,"And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the 			 			 captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from 			 			 the battle. "
3612,"And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? 			 			 "
3613,"Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill 			 			 every woman that hath known man by lying with him. "
3614,"But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying 			 			 with him, keep alive for yourselves. "
3615,And do ye abide without the camp seven days
3616,"And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and 			 			 all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood. "
3617,"And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to 			 			 the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded 			 			 Moses; "
3618,"And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall 			 			 be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp. "
3619,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3620,"And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one 			 			 portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of 			 			 the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, 			 			 which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. "
3621,And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded 			 			 Moses. 
3622,"And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war 			 			 had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five 			 			 thousand sheep, "
3623,"And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to 			 			 war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty 			 			 thousand and five hundred sheep"
3624,And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's 			 			 tribute was threescore and twelve. 
3625,And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which 			 			 the LORD's tribute was threescore and one. 
3626,And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's 			 			 tribute was thirty and two persons. 
3627,"And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, 			 			 unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. "
3628,"And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from 			 			 the men that warred, "
3629,"And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the 			 			 captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses"
3630,"We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every 			 			 man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, 			 			 earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the 			 			 LORD. "
3631,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all 			 			 wrought jewels. "
3632,"And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the 			 			 LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, 			 			 was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. "
3633,"(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) 			 			 "
3634,Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very 			 			 great multitude of cattle
3635,"And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of 			 			 Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? "
3636,"For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the 			 			 land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they 			 			 should not go into the land which the LORD had given them. "
3637,"And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, 			 			 saying, "
3638,"And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made 			 			 them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, 			 			 that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed. "
3639,"And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase 			 			 of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward 			 			 Israel. "
3640,"For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them 			 			 in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people. "
3641,"And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds 			 			 here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones"
3642,"We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel 			 			 have inherited every man his inheritance. "
3643,"For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or 			 			 forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan 			 			 eastward. "
3644,"And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will 			 			 go armed before the LORD to war, "
3645,"But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the 			 			 LORD"
3646,"Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; 			 			 and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. "
3647,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto 			 			 Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. "
3648,"Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, 			 			 shall be there in the cities of Gilead"
3649,"So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and 			 			 Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the 			 			 children of Israel"
3650,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, 			 			 saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do. "
3651,"We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, 			 			 that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be 			 			 ours. "
3652,"And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to 			 			 the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of 			 			 Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of 			 			 Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, 			 			 even the cities of the country round about. "
3653,"And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 			 			 "
3654,"And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and 			 			 Kirjathaim, "
3655,"And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, 			 			 and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it. "
3656,And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he 			 			 dwelt therein. 
3657,"And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns 			 			 thereof, and called them Havothjair. "
3658,"And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and 			 			 called it Nobah, after his own name. "
3659,"These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went 			 			 forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of 			 			 Moses and Aaron. "
3660,And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by 			 			 the commandment of the LORD
3661,"And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the 			 			 fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the 			 			 children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the 			 			 Egyptians. "
3662,"For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had 			 			 smitten among them"
3663,"And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in 			 			 Succoth. "
3664,"And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in 			 			 the edge of the wilderness. "
3665,"And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth, 			 			 which is before Baalzephon"
3666,"And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the 			 			 midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in 			 			 the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah. "
3667,"And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim"
3668,"And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea. "
3669,"And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the 			 			 wilderness of Sin. "
3670,"And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and 			 			 encamped in Dophkah. "
3671,"And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush. "
3672,"And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was 			 			 no water for the people to drink. "
3673,"And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness 			 			 of Sinai. "
3674,"And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at 			 			 Kibrothhattaavah. "
3675,"And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at 			 			 Hazeroth. "
3676,"And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah. "
3677,"And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez. "
3678,"And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah. "
3679,"And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah. "
3680,"And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah. "
3681,"And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher. "
3682,"And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah. "
3683,"And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth. "
3684,"And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath. "
3685,"And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah. "
3686,"And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah. "
3687,"And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah. "
3688,"And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth. "
3689,"And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan. "
3690,"And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad. "
3691,"And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah. "
3692,"And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah. "
3693,"And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber. "
3694,"And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness 			 			 of Zin, which is Kadesh. "
3695,"And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the 			 			 edge of the land of Edom. "
3696,"And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment 			 			 of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children 			 			 of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the 			 			 fifth month. "
3697,And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he 			 			 died in mount Hor. 
3698,"And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the 			 			 land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel. "
3699,"And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. "
3700,"And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. "
3701,"And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth. "
3702,"And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the 			 			 border of Moab. "
3703,"And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad. "
3704,"And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim. "
3705,"And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the 			 			 mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. "
3706,"And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in 			 			 the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. "
3707,"And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto 			 			 Abelshittim in the plains of Moab. "
3708,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan 			 			 near Jericho, saying, "
3709,And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among 			 			 your families
3710,"But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from 			 			 before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain 			 			 of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and 			 			 shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. "
3711,"Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I 			 			 thought to do unto them. "
3712,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3713,"And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea 			 			 for a border"
3714,And this shall be your north border
3715,And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to 			 			 Shepham
3716,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the 			 			 land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give 			 			 unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe"
3717,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3718,"And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land 			 			 by inheritance. "
3719,And the names of the men are these
3720,"And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of 			 			 Ammihud. "
3721,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. "
3722,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the 			 			 son of Jogli. "
3723,"The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the 			 			 children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod. "
3724,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel 			 			 the son of Shiphtan. "
3725,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, 			 			 Elizaphan the son of Parnach. "
3726,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel 			 			 the son of Azzan. "
3727,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the 			 			 son of Shelomi. "
3728,"And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel 			 			 the son of Ammihud. "
3729,These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance 			 			 unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan. 
3730,"And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan 			 			 near Jericho, saying, "
3731,"And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of 			 			 them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their 			 			 beasts. "
3732,"And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the 			 			 Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand 			 			 cubits round about. "
3733,"And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two 			 			 thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the 			 			 west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand 			 			 cubits; and the city shall be in the midst"
3734,"And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there 			 			 shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the 			 			 manslayer, that he may flee thither"
3735,So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be 			 			 forty and eight cities
3736,And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of 			 			 the children of Israel
3737,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, "
3738,"And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; 			 			 that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in 			 			 judgment. "
3739,And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have 			 			 for refuge. 
3740,"Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities 			 			 shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge. "
3741,"These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of 			 			 Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them"
3742,"And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, 			 			 he is a murderer"
3743,"And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, 			 			 and he die, he is a murderer"
3744,"Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may 			 			 die, and he die, he is a murderer"
3745,The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer
3746,"But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of 			 			 wait, that he die; "
3747,"But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon 			 			 him any thing without laying of wait, "
3748,"But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of 			 			 the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; "
3749,So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you 			 			 throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
3750,"Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by 			 			 the mouth of witnesses"
3751,"Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a 			 			 murderer, which is guilty of death"
3752,"And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the 			 			 city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, 			 			 until the death of the priest. "
3753,So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are
3754,"Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I 			 			 dwell"
3755,"And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, 			 			 the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of 			 			 Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the 			 			 chief fathers of the children of Israel"
3756,"And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of 			 			 the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the 			 			 inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the 			 			 tribe whereunto they are received"
3757,"And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then 			 			 shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe 			 			 whereunto they are received"
3758,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word 			 			 of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. "
3759,"This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the 			 			 daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think 			 			 best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they 			 			 marry. "
3760,So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove 			 			 from tribe to tribe
3761,"And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe 			 			 of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the 			 			 tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man 			 			 the inheritance of his fathers. "
3762,Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another 			 			 tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall 			 			 keep himself to his own inheritance. 
3763,"Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of 			 			 Zelophehad"
3764,"These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side 			 			 Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, 			 			 between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. "
3765,(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount 			 			 Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.) 
3766,"Behold, I have set the land before you"
3767,"And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear 			 			 you myself alone"
3768,"(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many 			 			 more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) "
3769,"And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is 			 			 good for us to do. "
3770,"So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made 			 			 them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over 			 			 hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and 			 			 officers among your tribes. "
3771,"And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes 			 			 between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his 			 			 brother, and the stranger that is with him. "
3772,Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the 			 			 small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; 			 			 for the judgment is God's
3773,And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should 			 			 do. 
3774,"And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great 			 			 and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of 			 			 the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to 			 			 Kadeshbarnea. "
3775,"And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the 			 			 Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us. "
3776,"Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee"
3777,"And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send 			 			 men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us 			 			 word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall 			 			 come. "
3778,And the saying pleased me well
3779,"And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and 			 			 brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a 			 			 good land which the LORD our God doth give us. "
3780,"Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the 			 			 commandment of the LORD your God"
3781,"Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, 			 			 saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great 			 			 and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the 			 			 Anakims there. "
3782,"Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. "
3783,"The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, 			 			 according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; "
3784,"Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, "
3785,"And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and 			 			 sware, saying, "
3786,"Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will 			 			 I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, 			 			 because he hath wholly followed the LORD. "
3787,"Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also 			 			 shalt not go in thither. "
3788,"But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall 			 			 go in thither"
3789,"Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and 			 			 your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and 			 			 evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they 			 			 shall possess it. "
3790,"But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the 			 			 wilderness by the way of the Red sea. "
3791,"Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the 			 			 LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God 			 			 commanded us. "
3792,"And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither 			 			 fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. "
3793,"So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against 			 			 the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill. "
3794,"And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against 			 			 you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto 			 			 Hormah. "
3795,"And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not 			 			 hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you. "
3796,"So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye 			 			 abode there. "
3797,"Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the 			 			 way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me"
3798,"And the LORD spake unto me, saying, "
3799,"And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the 			 			 coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and 			 			 they shall be afraid of you"
3800,"Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall 			 			 also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. "
3801,For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy 			 			 hand
3802,"And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, 			 			 which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from 			 			 Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. "
3803,"And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither 			 			 contend with them in battle"
3804,"The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, 			 			 and tall, as the Anakims; "
3805,"The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of 			 			 Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, 			 			 and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his 			 			 possession, which the LORD gave unto them. "
3806,"Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we 			 			 went over the brook Zered. "
3807,"And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were 			 			 come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the 			 			 generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as 			 			 the LORD sware unto them. "
3808,"For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them 			 			 from among the host, until they were consumed. "
3809,"So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and 			 			 dead from among the people, "
3810,(That also was accounted a land of giants
3811,"This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of 			 			 thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear 			 			 report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. "
3812,"And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto 			 			 Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, "
3813,"Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me 			 			 water for money, that I may drink"
3814,But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him
3815,"And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and 			 			 his land before thee"
3816,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight 			 			 at Jahaz. "
3817,"And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, 			 			 and his sons, and all his people. "
3818,"And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed 			 			 the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left 			 			 none to remain"
3819,"From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from 			 			 the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one 			 			 city too strong for us"
3820,"Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan"
3821,"And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not"
3822,"So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of 			 			 Bashan, and all his people"
3823,"And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city 			 			 which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of 			 			 Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. "
3824,"All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; 			 			 beside unwalled towns a great many. "
3825,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of 			 			 Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every 			 			 city. "
3826,"But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a 			 			 prey to ourselves. "
3827,"And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the 			 			 Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of 			 			 Arnon unto mount Hermon; "
3828,"For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; 			 			 behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of 			 			 the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four 			 			 cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. "
3829,"And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which 			 			 is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, 			 			 gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. "
3830,"And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, 			 			 gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with 			 			 all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. "
3831,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the 			 			 coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, 			 			 Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. "
3832,And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
3833,"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead 			 			 even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto 			 			 the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; "
3834,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath 			 			 given you this land to possess it"
3835,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I 			 			 know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I 			 			 have given you; "
3836,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen 			 			 all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings"
3837,Ye shall not fear them
3838,"And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, "
3839,"But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear 			 			 me"
3840,"Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes 			 			 westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it 			 			 with thine eyes"
3841,"But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him"
3842,So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor. 
3843,"Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the 			 			 judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go 			 			 in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. "
3844,"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall 			 			 ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the 			 			 LORD your God which I command you. "
3845,Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor
3846,But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one 			 			 of you this day. 
3847,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD 			 			 my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to 			 			 possess it. "
3848,"Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your 			 			 understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these 			 			 statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and 			 			 understanding people. "
3849,"For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, 			 			 as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? "
3850,"And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain 			 			 burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and 			 			 thick darkness. "
3851,And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire
3852,"And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to 			 			 perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of 			 			 stone. "
3853,"And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and 			 			 judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to 			 			 possess it. "
3854,Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner 			 			 of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of 			 			 the midst of the fire
3855,"But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the 			 			 iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of 			 			 inheritance, as ye are this day. "
3856,"Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware 			 			 that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto 			 			 that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance"
3857,"Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the 			 			 LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or 			 			 the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. "
3858,"For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. "
3859,"When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye 			 			 shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, 			 			 and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do 			 			 evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger"
3860,"And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be 			 			 left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you. "
3861,"And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and 			 			 stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. "
3862,"But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt 			 			 find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. "
3863,"When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon 			 			 thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and 			 			 shalt be obedient unto his voice; "
3864,"For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, 			 			 since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the 			 			 one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such 			 			 thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? "
3865,"Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might 			 			 instruct thee"
3866,"And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed 			 			 after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power 			 			 out of Egypt; "
3867,"Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the 			 			 LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath"
3868,"Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, 			 			 which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with 			 			 thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon 			 			 the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever. "
3869,Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the 			 			 sunrising; 
3870,And this is the law which Moses set before the children of 			 			 Israel
3871,"On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the 			 			 land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses 			 			 and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of 			 			 Egypt"
3872,"And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, 			 			 the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that 			 			 ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. "
3873,The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 
3874,"The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, 			 			 even us, who are all of us here alive this day. "
3875,"The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the 			 			 midst of the fire, "
3876,Thou shalt have none other gods before me. 
3877,"Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any 			 			 thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or 			 			 that is in the waters beneath the earth"
3878,Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain
3879,"Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath 			 			 commanded thee. "
3880,"Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work"
3881,"And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and 			 			 that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand 			 			 and by a stretched out arm"
3882,"Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath 			 			 commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go 			 			 well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. "
3883,Thou shalt not kill. 
3884,Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 
3885,Neither shalt thou steal. 
3886,Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
3887,"Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt 			 			 thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his 			 			 maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's. "
3888,"These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount 			 			 out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, 			 			 with a great voice"
3889,"And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of 			 			 the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near 			 			 unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; "
3890,Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume 			 			 us
3891,"For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the 			 			 living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and 			 			 lived? "
3892,"And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto 			 			 me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of 			 			 this people, which they have spoken unto thee"
3893,"O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, 			 			 and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, 			 			 and with their children for ever! "
3894,"But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto 			 			 thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which 			 			 thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give 			 			 them to possess it. "
3895,Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath 			 			 commanded you
3896,"Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath 			 			 commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and 			 			 that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess. "
3897,"Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, 			 			 which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them 			 			 in the land whither ye go to possess it"
3898,"Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be 			 			 well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of 			 			 thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and 			 			 honey. "
3899,"Hear, O Israel"
3900,"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine 			 			 heart"
3901,"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they 			 			 shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. "
3902,"And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy 			 			 gates. "
3903,"And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee 			 			 into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, 			 			 and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou 			 			 buildedst not, "
3904,"Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear 			 			 by his name. "
3905,"Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which 			 			 are round about you; "
3906,"Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in 			 			 Massah. "
3907,"Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, 			 			 and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. "
3908,And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of 			 			 the LORD
3909,"To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath 			 			 spoken. "
3910,"And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean 			 			 the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD 			 			 our God hath commanded you? "
3911,"And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the 			 			 LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as 			 			 it is at this day. "
3912,"And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these 			 			 commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us. "
3913,"When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou 			 			 goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the 			 			 Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, 			 			 and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations 			 			 greater and mightier than thou; "
3914,"For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may 			 			 serve other gods"
3915,"But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, 			 			 and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their 			 			 graven images with fire. "
3916,For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God
3917,"The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye 			 			 were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all 			 			 people"
3918,"Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, 			 			 which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his 			 			 commandments to a thousand generations; "
3919,"Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and 			 			 the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. "
3920,"Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these 			 			 judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep 			 			 unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers"
3921,Thou shalt be blessed above all people
3922,"And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put 			 			 none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but 			 			 will lay them upon all them that hate thee. "
3923,And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God 			 			 shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them
3924,"If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; 			 			 how can I dispossess them? "
3925,"Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until 			 			 they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed. "
3926,Thou shalt not be affrighted at them
3927,And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by 			 			 little and little
3928,"But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall 			 			 destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. "
3929,"And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt 			 			 destroy their name from under heaven"
3930,The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire
3931,"Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest 			 			 thou be a cursed thing like it"
3932,"All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye 			 			 observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess 			 			 the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. "
3933,"And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led 			 			 thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove 			 			 thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his 			 			 commandments, or no. "
3934,"And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee 			 			 with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that 			 			 he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by 			 			 every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. "
3935,"Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, 			 			 these forty years. "
3936,"Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth 			 			 his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. "
3937,"Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to 			 			 walk in his ways, and to fear him. "
3938,"For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of 			 			 brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys 			 			 and hills; "
3939,"When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD 			 			 thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. "
3940,"Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his 			 			 commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command 			 			 thee this day"
3941,But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God
3942,"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and 			 			 walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify 			 			 against you this day that ye shall surely perish. "
3943,"As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so 			 			 shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of 			 			 the LORD your God. "
3944,"Hear, O Israel"
3945,"Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath 			 			 cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD 			 			 hath brought me in to possess this land"
3946,"Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, 			 			 dost thou go to possess their land"
3947,"Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this 			 			 good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a 			 			 stiffnecked people. "
3948,"Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to 			 			 wrath in the wilderness"
3949,"Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was 			 			 angry with you to have destroyed you. "
3950,"When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, 			 			 even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I 			 			 abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat 			 			 bread nor drink water"
3951,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, 			 			 that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the 			 			 covenant. "
3952,"And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from 			 			 hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have 			 			 corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way 			 			 which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. "
3953,"Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this 			 			 people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people"
3954,"So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned 			 			 with fire"
3955,"And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your 			 			 God, and had made you a molten calf"
3956,"And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and 			 			 brake them before your eyes. "
3957,"And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and 			 			 forty nights"
3958,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the 			 			 LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto 			 			 me at that time also. "
3959,And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him
3960,"And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it 			 			 with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was 			 			 as small as dust"
3961,"And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye 			 			 provoked the LORD to wrath. "
3962,"Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up 			 			 and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against 			 			 the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor 			 			 hearkened to his voice. "
3963,Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew 			 			 you. 
3964,"Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as 			 			 I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy 			 			 you. "
3965,"I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy 			 			 not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through 			 			 thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a 			 			 mighty hand. "
3966,"Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto 			 			 the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their 			 			 sin"
3967,"Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou 			 			 broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. "
3968,"At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone 			 			 like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee 			 			 an ark of wood. "
3969,"And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first 			 			 tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. "
3970,"And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone 			 			 like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables 			 			 in mine hand. "
3971,"And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the 			 			 ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of 			 			 the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly"
3972,"And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the 			 			 tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD 			 			 commanded me. "
3973,And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the 			 			 children of Jaakan to Mosera
3974,"From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to 			 			 Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. "
3975,"At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the 			 			 ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister 			 			 unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. "
3976,"Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; 			 			 the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised 			 			 him. "
3977,"And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty 			 			 days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time 			 			 also, and the LORD would not destroy thee. "
3978,"And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the 			 			 people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto 			 			 their fathers to give unto them. "
3979,"And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but 			 			 to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, 			 			 and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy 			 			 soul, "
3980,"Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he 			 			 chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this 			 			 day. "
3981,"Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more 			 			 stiffnecked. "
3982,"For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great 			 			 God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh 			 			 reward"
3983,Love ye therefore the stranger
3984,"Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to 			 			 him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. "
3985,"He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee 			 			 these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen. "
3986,Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten 			 			 persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of 			 			 heaven for multitude. 
3987,"Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, 			 			 and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway. "
3988,And know ye this day
3989,"Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you 			 			 this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, 			 			 whither ye go to possess it; "
3990,"For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the 			 			 land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, 			 			 and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs"
3991,"And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto 			 			 my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your 			 			 God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, 			 			 "
3992,"And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou 			 			 mayest eat and be full. "
3993,"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye 			 			 turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; "
3994,"Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in 			 			 your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be 			 			 as frontlets between your eyes. "
3995,"And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when 			 			 thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when 			 			 thou liest down, and when thou risest up. "
3996,"And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, 			 			 and upon thy gates"
3997,"For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I 			 			 command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his 			 			 ways, and to cleave unto him; "
3998,Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be 			 			 yours
3999,There shall no man be able to stand before you
4000,"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; "
4001,"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought 			 			 thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou 			 			 shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount 			 			 Ebal. "
4002,"Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun 			 			 goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the 			 			 champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? "
4003,And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which 			 			 I set before you this day. 
4004,"These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to 			 			 do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to 			 			 possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. "
4005,"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations 			 			 which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and 			 			 upon the hills, and under every green tree"
4006,Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. 
4007,"But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of 			 			 all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall 			 			 ye seek, and thither thou shalt come"
4008,"Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, 			 			 every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes. "
4009,"For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, 			 			 which the LORD your God giveth you. "
4010,"But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD 			 			 your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all 			 			 your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; "
4011,Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in 			 			 every place that thou seest
4012,"Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, 			 			 whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the 			 			 LORD thy God which he hath given thee"

4058,"Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, 			 			 The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be 			 			 evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry 			 			 unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee. "
4059,"Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved 			 			 when thou givest unto him"
4060,For the poor shall never cease out of the land

4077,Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread
4078,Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee
4079,"And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God 			 			 with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt 			 			 give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed 			 			 thee"

4103,"The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, 			 			 and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him. "
4104,"For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to 			 			 stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever. "
4105,"And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, 			 			 where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the 			 			 place which the LORD shall choose; "

4204,"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither 			 			 shall the children be put to death for the fathers"
4205,"Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the 			 			 fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge"
4206,"When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast 			 			 forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it"
4207,"When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the 			 			 boughs again"
4208,"When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not 			 			 glean it afterward"
4209,And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of 			 			 Egypt
4210,"If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto 			 			 judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the 			 			 righteous, and condemn the wicked. "
4211,"And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that 			 			 the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his 			 			 face, according to his fault, by a certain number. "
4212,"Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed"
4213,Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. 
4214,"If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no 			 			 child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger"
4215,"And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall 			 			 succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not 			 			 put out of Israel. "
4216,"And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his 			 			 brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My 			 			 husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in 			 			 Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother. "
4217,"Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him"
4218,"And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that 			 			 hath his shoe loosed. "
4219,"When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the 			 			 one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him 			 			 that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the 			 			 secrets"
4220,"Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a 			 			 small. "
4221,"Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and 			 			 a small. "
4222,"But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and 			 			 just measure shalt thou have"
4223,"For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are 			 			 an abomination unto the LORD thy God. "
4224,"Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come 			 			 forth out of Egypt; "
4225,"Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee 			 			 rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD 			 			 thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt 			 			 blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not 			 			 forget it. "
4226,"And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the 			 			 LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and 			 			 dwellest therein; "
4227,"And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, 			 			 and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am 			 			 come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to 			 			 give us. "
4228,"And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set 			 			 it down before the altar of the LORD thy God. "
4229,"And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian 			 			 ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and 			 			 sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, 			 			 and populous"
4230,"And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, 			 			 which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the 			 			 LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God"
4231,"When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine 			 			 increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given 			 			 it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that 			 			 they may eat within thy gates, and be filled; "
4232,"I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken 			 			 away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for 			 			 the dead"
4233,"Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy 			 			 people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest 			 			 unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey. "
4234,This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these 			 			 statutes and judgments

4236,"And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, 			 			 Keep all the commandments which I command you this day. "
4237,"And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto 			 			 the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee 			 			 up great stones, and plaister them with plaister"
4238,"Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall 			 			 set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and 			 			 thou shalt plaister them with plaister. "
4239,"And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an 			 			 altar of stones"
4240,Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones
4241,And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law 			 			 very plainly. 
4242,"And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, 			 			 saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the 			 			 people of the LORD thy God. "
4243,"Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do 			 			 his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day. "
4244,"And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, "
4245,"And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel 			 			 with a loud voice, "
4246,"Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And 			 			 all the people shall say, Amen. "
4247,"Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the 			 			 people shall say, Amen. "
4248,"Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And 			 			 all the people shall say, Amen. "
4249,"Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, 			 			 fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen. "
4250,"Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he 			 			 uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen. "
4251,"Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the 			 			 people shall say, Amen. "
4252,"Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his 			 			 father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, 			 			 Amen. "
4253,"Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the 			 			 people shall say, Amen. "
4254,"Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the 			 			 people shall say, Amen. "
4255,"Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And 			 			 all the people shall say, Amen. "
4256,"Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do 			 			 them. And all the people shall say, Amen. "
4257,"And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto 			 			 the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his 			 			 commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will 			 			 set thee on high above all nations of the earth"
4258,"Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in 			 			 the field. "
4259,"Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy 			 			 ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the 			 			 flocks of thy sheep. "
4260,Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

4264,"The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he 			 			 hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD 			 			 thy God, and walk in his ways. "
4265,And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by 			 			 the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee. 
4266,"And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of 			 			 thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy 			 			 ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give 			 			 thee. "
4267,"The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to 			 			 give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work 			 			 of thine hand"
4268,"And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and 			 			 thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou 			 			 hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command 			 			 thee this day, to observe and to do them"
4269,"But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the 			 			 voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and 			 			 his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses 			 			 shall come upon thee, and overtake thee"
4270,Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store. 
4271,"Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy 			 			 land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. "
4272,"Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou 			 			 be when thou goest out. "
4273,"The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in 			 			 all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be 			 			 destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of 			 			 thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me. "
4274,"The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he 			 			 have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess 			 			 it. "
4275,"The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, 			 			 and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the 			 			 sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee 			 			 until thou perish. "
4276,"And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the 			 			 earth that is under thee shall be iron. "
4277,The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust
4278,The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies
4279,"And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and 			 			 unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away. "
4280,"The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the 			 			 emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not 			 			 be healed. "
4281,"The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and 			 			 astonishment of heart"
4282,"Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her"
4283,"Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not 			 			 eat thereof"
4284,"Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, 			 			 and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day 			 			 long; and there shall be no might in thine hand. "
4285,"The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which 			 			 thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed 			 			 alway"
4286,"The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a 			 			 sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the 			 			 top of thy head. "
4287,"The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set 			 			 over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have 			 			 known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone. "
4288,"And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, 			 			 among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee. "
4289,"Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather 			 			 but little in; for the locust shall consume it. "
4290,"Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither 			 			 drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat 			 			 them. "
4291,"Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou 			 			 shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his 			 			 fruit. "
4292,"Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy 			 			 them; for they shall go into captivity. "
4293,All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume. 
4294,The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very 			 			 high; and thou shalt come down very low. 
4295,"He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him"
4296,"Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue 			 			 thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou 			 			 hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his 			 			 commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee"
4297,"Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and 			 			 with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things; "
4298,"The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the 			 			 end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue 			 			 thou shalt not understand; "
4299,"And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and 			 			 fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy 			 			 land"
4300,"And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy 			 			 sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in 			 			 the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall 			 			 distress thee"
4301,"The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not 			 			 adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness 			 			 and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, 			 			 and toward her son, and toward her daughter, "
4302,"If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that 			 			 are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and 			 			 fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; "
4303,"Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, 			 			 which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. "
4304,"Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in 			 			 the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou 			 			 be destroyed. "
4305,"And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars 			 			 of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of 			 			 the LORD thy God. "
4306,"And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to 			 			 do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to 			 			 destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from 			 			 off the land whither thou goest to possess it. "
4307,"And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one 			 			 end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other 			 			 gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and 			 			 stone. "
4308,"And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall 			 			 the sole of thy foot have rest"
4309,"And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by 			 			 the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again"
4310,"These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded 			 			 Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside 			 			 the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. "
4311,"And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have 			 			 seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto 			 			 Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; "
4312,And I have led you forty years in the wilderness
4313,"Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong 			 			 drink"
4314,"And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and 			 			 Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote 			 			 them"
4315,"Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye 			 			 may prosper in all that ye do. "
4316,"Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your 			 			 captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the 			 			 men of Israel, "
4317,Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; 			 			 
4318,"And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes 			 			 of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are 			 			 written in this book of the law"
4319,The secret things belong unto the LORD our God
4320,"And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon 			 			 thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and 			 			 thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD 			 			 thy God hath driven thee, "
4321,"If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, 			 			 from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he 			 			 fetch thee"
4322,"And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart 			 			 of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with 			 			 all thy soul, that thou mayest live. "
4323,"And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine 			 			 enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee. "
4324,"And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all 			 			 his commandments which I command thee this day. "
4325,"And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of 			 			 thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, 			 			 and in the fruit of thy land, for good"
4326,"For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not 			 			 hidden from thee, neither is it far off. "
4327,"It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up 			 			 for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do 			 			 it? "
4328,"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death 			 			 and evil; "
4329,"But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but 			 			 shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; "
4330,"I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I 			 			 have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing"
4331,And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 
4332,"And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this 			 			 day; I can no more go out and come in"
4333,"The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will 			 			 destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them"
4334,"And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, 			 			 kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed. "
4335,"And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do 			 			 unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded 			 			 you. "
4336,"Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them"
4337,"And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of 			 			 all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage"
4338,"And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with 			 			 thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee"
4339,"And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the 			 			 sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto 			 			 all the elders of Israel. "
4340,"And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven 			 			 years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of 			 			 tabernacles, "
4341,"Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy 			 			 stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they 			 			 may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words 			 			 of this law"
4342,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that 			 			 thou must die"
4343,And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud
4344,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy 			 			 fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods 			 			 of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and 			 			 will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. "
4345,"Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I 			 			 will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall 			 			 be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that 			 			 they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because 			 			 our God is not among us? "
4346,"Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the 			 			 children of Israel"
4347,"For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware 			 			 unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall 			 			 have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn 			 			 unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my 			 			 covenant. "
4348,"And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are 			 			 befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; 			 			 for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed"
4349,"Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the 			 			 children of Israel. "
4350,"And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong 			 			 and of a good courage"
4351,"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the 			 			 words of this law in a book, until they were finished, "
4352,"For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck"
4353,"For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt 			 			 yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; 			 			 and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil 			 			 in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of 			 			 your hands. "
4354,"And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel 			 			 the words of this song, until they were ended. "
4355,"Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the 			 			 words of my mouth. "
4356,"My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the 			 			 dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon 			 			 the grass"
4357,"He is the Rock, his work is perfect"
4358,"They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his 			 			 children"
4359,"Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not 			 			 he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and 			 			 established thee? "
4360,"When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when 			 			 he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people 			 			 according to the number of the children of Israel. "
4361,For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his 			 			 inheritance. 
4362,"He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling 			 			 wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the 			 			 apple of his eye. "
4363,"As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, 			 			 spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings"
4364,"He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might 			 			 eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of 			 			 the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; "
4365,"But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked"
4366,"They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with 			 			 abominations provoked they him to anger. "
4367,"They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew 			 			 not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. "
4368,"Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast 			 			 forgotten God that formed thee. "
4369,"And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the 			 			 provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. "
4370,"And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what 			 			 their end shall be"
4371,They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they 			 			 have provoked me to anger with their vanities
4372,"For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the 			 			 lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on 			 			 fire the foundations of the mountains. "
4373,I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon 			 			 them. 
4374,"They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, 			 			 and with bitter destruction"
4375,"The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the 			 			 young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray 			 			 hairs. "
4376,"I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the 			 			 remembrance of them to cease from among men"
4377,"For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any 			 			 understanding in them. "
4378,"O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they 			 			 would consider their latter end! "
4379,"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of 			 			 Gomorrah"
4380,"Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my 			 			 treasures? "
4381,"For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his 			 			 servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none 			 			 shut up, or left. "
4382,"And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they 			 			 trusted, "
4383,"See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me"
4384,"For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. "
4385,"If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on 			 			 judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward 			 			 them that hate me. "
4386,"I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall 			 			 devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the 			 			 captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. "
4387,"Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people"
4388,"And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears 			 			 of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. "
4389,And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel
